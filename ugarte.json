You know abot Flakland\nislas (las Islas Malvinas) and war ago 20 years? No good for argentino. So i go\nto Buenos Aires, then to San Pablo (Brasil). I look at flights now. Posible\nform San Pablo directo to Milano (Italy) or Madrid (Spain). Spain is more good\nbut problema is argentino acento is obviuos. So i go to Milano then to England\nbecuase when in Italy or Spain easier more becuase then in Europa Union.\n\nI have other problema also. Me group had touff works in dirty war against\ncomunistas and \"izquierdistas\" (sory, not know english word) and democratistas\nme want it prison for humans rights of charges. You know abot General Pinochet\nin Chile? Arrestan in London ago thre years.\n\nBut I think more good for a miembro my group in Buenos Aires us help. We were\nmilitars and have more good disciplan so no a problema. Is OK for you son? In\nArgentina are some englishspeaker and one me men speak english very good. Me\nproblema is to find he now but think he is in Italy. Maybe take other day or\nso.\n\nHave you thinked already abot laundry of moneys?

Obviously the idea of the Colonel\nproviding a little \"gentle persuasion\" to the agent to get him to waive the fee\nhas not found favour.\nBy the way, while demurrage would normally accrue to a consignment not\ncollected immediately from a port, a fee of \u00a3100 might be reasonable. \u00a318,000\nwould be a right royal rip off even in England where everything is very\nexpensive. I have a little experience of importing, and one consignment I dealt\nwith weighed 210 kg and was stored at a port for three weeks, yet the demurrage\nwas less than NZ$100 (about \u00a330).
