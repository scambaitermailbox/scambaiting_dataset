Synopsis of \nconversation:\n\n- She really really appreciates what I have done.\n\n- What I have done with the house is really really\ngood.\n\n- I should give her my mobile phone number.  Nope,\ndon't use one.\n\n- She will go to the lawyer's office and I will have\nall of the documents tomorrow.  They\nhave been ready but she needed to talk to me first\nbecause then she can know she\ncan really really trust me you know.\n\n- I should get a mobile phone for use in Belgium.  I\ndeclined, I want to have all \nof my information in writing before I go.  She was\nreally hot on this point, I said\nit was really stupid to use mobile phones.\n\n- I should be in Belgium Tuesday or Wednesday.  I said\nthere is no way this is \nhappening since I don't have the documents yet.\n\n- She really really appreciates what I have done. \nReally really.\n\n- I should trust the lawyer, he is doing what she says\nto do.  I told her the lawyer \nmust answer all of the questions in my last email\nfirst.\n\n- The security company is Credit Partners\nInternational in Belgium (no Google hits).  \nIn Benin it is called Global Security Company (no\nGoogle hits).\n\n- The house costs $2.7 million, I told her she has to\nput at least $500,000 down. She \nasked again about the swimming pool.\n\nThe phone card was running down so I cut off \"to brief my employees on their new benefits package\".  She was still talking when I cut off.  She may still be yammering away.\n\nWhat were those critical items we had to discuss? They never came up.  Like all lads she just wanted me to bond with her and buy into her story.\n\nShe's REALLY REALLY excited now.  I see more abuse\na-comin'.

And he had contacted a Brussels local\nwho would be taking pictures at the \nairport.  This presented a tremendous opportunity to\ndisrupt both sets of lads AND\nhave each of them blame the other!\n\nFirst, I need to make nice and get my lads to come\nmeet me at the airport.  So kindly \nexcuse me suddenly apologizing and being nice to the\ncriminals.", "UNKINDLY CONTRIBUTOR places another phone call to Mrs\nTaylor\n\nHighlights:\n\n- \"We are like family,\" she says.  In this family\ntree, she's the nut.\n\n- The security company will pick me up from my hotel. \nThat's their security\nprotocol (for kidnappings, most assuredly).  No, wait,\nI will call them from \nthe airport and they will pick me up.  That way I can\nsave on the hotel bill\nby flying out that night.\n\n- Can I \"please please please not be rude to the\nsecurity company\".  Sure thing.\n\n- They will - direct quote - \"make up a document\" as a\nreceipt for me paying\nthe 23,255 Euros.  I have no doubt this is a true\nstatement.\n\n- The deal on the house has been extended by a week so\nwe have until next\nFriday to get the check to DC.\n\n- Once we do the transfer she will give me the address\nto send the magic\ncredit card to.\n\n- It's cold in Paris, about 34 F today.  The second\nand final true statement\nof the call.\n\nWhen we hung up she was positively giddy.", "Now then, gentle readers, here is the plan:\n\nThere is another bait going on, with a separate set of\nlads and a separate baiter\n(Biff Pileon).  He has altered his flight schedule so\nnow they are supposed to meet him \nat the airport on Monday.  Same flight as me.\n\nSo there will be two sets of lads at the airport.  And\nthere to watch them will be\nthe third baiter, Nico, who will make the trip to the\nairport.\n\nHere is what will happen:\n\nNico will take pictures of the lads waiting.\n\nThen he will call the lads who are waiting and,\nportraying a lad, he will tell BOTH of \nthem that he has picked up their magas, their victims.\n The lads will be furious -\nthey HATE losing their victims to other lads.\n\nHe will tell Biff's lads that he is dressed like my\nlads.  He will tell my lads that he \nis dressed like Biff's lads.  He will then direct them\nto meet to discuss the payoff.  He\nwill direct them to LE MACHO - a gay sauna in\nBrussels.  And there they will come together,\neach thinking the other has kidnapped his victim.\n\n:)\n\nThat's the plot.  Eat your heart out, Ian Fleming.", "As far as pics are concerned, I took several nice pics\nat the airport,\nbut couldn't do any at the sauna, either the camera\nblocked somehow or \nit was the last pic I don't know. \n\nFor a conclusion I have to say everything was\nsuccesfull, not\n\"everything\" happened exactly like it had to but most\nof it was great,\nthey were both at the airport, were quite shocked when\nI called,\nespecially one who was even really scared. One\n(perhaps two) did get to\nthe gay sauna. As far as I am concerned, I had no\nproblems, was not\nfollowed by anyone and did have great fun ! \nHere are their photos as they wait for the plane. \nPlay Spot the Mugu!\nPileon's lad is in leather, UC's is shown in profile\nin the bottom photo.", "MONDAY, 6:00 PM Brussels time:\n\nNo word from the lads yet.  I think they have no idea\nwhat to do next.\nThis just isn't in their script.  Surely they didn't\ngo through four \nmonths of \"work\" to have it end like this.  Tough\nnight in Muguville.", "MONDAY, 6:15 PM Brussels time:  Ah, here we go.\n\nMrs Ngoma Taylor, still in Benin, plays dumb.

I told her she can just \nkeep the Jeep until her car is fixed.   After we\nfigured out the house\nissues we had a nice time together by the pool; it was\nhot so we rubbed oil all \nover each other.  How I wish it were you in my hands\ninstead!  She did not seem to be\nintimidated by nudity as you seem to be, and even\nvolunteered to give me a great \nmassage.  So I think she will be great to work with as\nwe go forward.  I look forward to \nhaving you here so the three of us can get together\nand resolve any outstanding home issues. <br><br>\n\nThat's the news from here.  Send the photo immediately\nand I will send the money as \nrequested.  I have already spent over $200,000 on you\nand while that may seem like a \nsmall amount of money to you it is signficant.  Please\nstop delaying the photo.\nNothing else can happen until I receive it.<br><br>\n\n\n<b>Mrs Ngoma can't remember how old her kids are.
