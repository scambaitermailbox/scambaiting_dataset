Please address me as \"Harry\", \"Harold\", \"Harry Fadgina\", \"Mr Fadgina\", \"Sir\" or even \"008\".\n <br /><br />\nSecondly there are a couple of issues of concern over the affadavit. In paragraph 2, you state that I am of the \"Felchingam\" region when, in actual fact, I live in FelchingHam. Please correct this typographical error because, as I'm sure as a barrister you will be aware, it will invalidate the affadavit. \n <br /><br />\nAlso, in paragraph 4, it says that I am a secret agent with M16 - this should be \"MI6\", i.e. a letter \"I\" and not the number \"1\". Paragraph 4 also states \"and presently disc overture\", which makes no bloody sense at all. Is that some kind of special legal jargon?<br /><br />\n \nNot a very impressive performance so far, Peter. Please get it right from now on, as you will be aware of how important attention to small details can be, especially after you have already paid so much in stamp duty and oath fees.<br /><br />\n \nSort it out man, and then we can talk.<br /><br />\n \nSincerely<br />\nHarry Fadgina 008\n \n \n</div>\n</div>\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "", "author_role": "scam", "body": "PURPLE HELMET\n\n\n10 July 2008\n\n\nHello Harry,\n \nI got your email and I have noted  what you are saying concerning the form sent to you, anyway I Willl proceed to High Court to put everything in other, So I have told you to provide your phone number to enhance our communication.\n \nI want to make sure you forward the telephone number to me in your next email to enable me have a free intention on your assistance.\n \nI will update you as soon as Correct the error, the Oath Minister have started the procurements today and I will soon inform you of the outcome of everything.\n \nAm counting on you here don't let me down because i don't want this fund to be confiscated by the bank.\n \nWaiting for your reply.\n \nBest Regards,\nBarr.Voo Petter.", "raw": "<div id=\"record\">\n<div id=\"char\"><span class=\"vp\">Voo Petter</span></div>\n<div id=\"dialog\" class=\"st\">\n\n<span class=\"code\">PURPLE HELMET</span><br /><br />\n\n\n10 July 2008<br /><br />\n\n\nHello Harry,<br /><br />\n \nI got your email and I have noted  what you are saying concerning the form sent to you, anyway I Willl proceed to High Court to put everything in other, So I have told you to provide your phone number to enhance our communication.<br /><br />\n \nI want to make sure you forward the telephone number to me in your next email to enable me have a free intention on your assistance.<br /><br />\n \nI will update you as soon as Correct the error, the Oath Minister have started the procurements today and I will soon inform you of the outcome of everything.<br /><br />\n \nAm counting on you here don't let me down because i don't want this fund to be confiscated by the bank.<br /><br />\n \nWaiting for your reply.<br /><br />\n \nBest Regards,<br />\nBarr.Voo Petter.\n \n \n\n</div>\n</div>\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "", "author_role": "bait", "body": "10 July 2008\n\nPete\n \nLet me know as soon as you have corrected the error, and don't let it happen again.
