I am Mr.Simeon Wang an Attorney based in London. I Hoped that you will not expose or betray this trust and confident that I am about to repose on you for the mutual benefit of our both families.<br>\nI am writing in respect of a foreign customer of our company who perished along with his next of kin with Korean Air Line, flight number 801 with the whole passengers on 6th of augustus 1997 and for your perusal you can view this site http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9708/06/guam.passenger.list\nSince the demise of this our customer, I personally has watched with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds of US$18.3M (Eighteen Million Three Hundred Thoudsand United States Dollars) which has been with our company for a very long time.<br>\nOn this note, I decided to seek for whom his name shall be used as the Next of Kin since nobody is coming for the fund again. The Banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than 10 years, because the money will be recalled to the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund after this period.  In view of this I got your contact through the internet when I was making a research on a foreigner that I will use in this great  opportunity because I don't want the money to be recalled to our Bank treasury as uncliamed fund. <br>\nI have also agreed to offer 50% of the total sum and the balanace of 50% will be for me.\nThe reason for a foreigner in the business is for the fact that the deceased man was a foreigner and it is not authorized by the law guiding our Bank for a citizen of this country to make the claim of the fund. So the request of you as a foreigner is necessary to apply for the release and transfer of the fund smoothly into your reliable Bank account as the surviving relation to the deceased.\nIf you are really sure of your integerity, trustworthy and confidentiality, and accept not to cheat or disappoint me after this business, reply with your telephone and fax numbers and banking account details where you wish to receive the fund.<br>\nUpon receipt of the above mentioned informations, indicating your interest in the business, I will send you by fax or e-mail a letter of  application which you will type  and send back to our company to enable us start this transaction.<br>\nI will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch free and dont have any negative impact. You should not entertain any fear as all modalities for the smooth and easy transfer of this fund has been finalized, this transaction will be completed within 14 working days immediately we start the business.<br>\nWaiting for your urgent response and please kindly delete if you are not interested.<br>\nRegards,<br>\nSIMEON WANG   QC.<br>\n16-18 STRUHON GROUND<br>\nLONDON   SW3P 2HP.<br>\nNB: It is important that you read this proposal carefully, for a better  understanding.
