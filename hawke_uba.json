Right? Or do you do this in your sleep or something.<br><br>\n\nI am Stuart de Baker Hawke famed anti scammer.<br><br>\n\nAre you getting that bit? I sent you some links. I was in the New York Times as a Famed anti scam guy.\n<br><br>\nI am also a computer expert. I can trace the computers you use. I send that information to the police in\nyour area.<br><br>\n\nObviously seeing as you wouldn't really use your real name unless you have less brains than a brick. <br><br>\n\nThen the cops can't just come and get you.<br>\n\nThey don't know who you really are.<br>\n\nJust what you call yourself and where you mail from.<br>\n\nMaybe they will watch for you, maybe not. Actually probably not.<br><br>\n\nI wouldn't worry to much about it this time.<br>\n\nYou are such a small time scammer I didn't waste to much time on you.<br><br>\n\nBut it was easy to mail all the other levels men, chairmen etc that Lucky Uba was  a gay goat fucker. Not to mention \nan idiot who was known to the police.<br><br>\n\nI have a list. A BIG list. I sent all your stupid mails and what I know about you to my LIST.<br><br>\n\nAbout 7000 people or well mail boxes anyway a lot are other crooks who have many mailboxes. All over the world.<br><br>\n\nVery boring scam though. I doubt I can get your mails posted on the internet. Not interesting enough.\n<br><br>\nYou don't even seem to read my replies.<br>\n\nCan you read?<br>\n\nOr do you just copy and paste based on keywords and phrases?<br><br>\n\nJust go and make love to your goat and try to understand that you will never be a bit time crook who\nmakes lots of money.<br><br>\n\nBut if you can read this far and you would like to make some money honestly instead. Well maybe \nI can help.<br><br>\n\nIs $100.00 US a month enough?<br>\n\nBut you would have to tell me a LOT of truth and promise not to scam  anymore.\n<br><br>\nStew<br><br>\n\nPS HA HA! I bet you didn't even read that far. But yes I can easily afford to pay that if I get what I \nwant.\n</span><br><br>\n\n<span class=\"shc\">\nSurely THAT should shut him up?\n\n</span><br><br>\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "", "author_role": "scam", "body": "Stuart \n\nthis is for real ok,but the mistake you people always make is you just talking what you dont know ok,\n\nif you like take my name to any police or investigate about me then you will find out if iam for real or not ok,\n\nif you are for real let go into this transaction,or OTU NNEGI there ok.\n\nlucky uba", "raw": "<hr><span class=\"uba\">LUCKY UBA</span><br><br><span class=\"st\">\n\nStuart <br>\n\nthis is for real ok,but the mistake you people always make is you just talking what you dont know ok,<br><br>\n\nif you like take my name to any police or investigate about me then you will find out if iam for real or not ok,<br><br>\n\nif you are for real let go into this transaction,or OTU NNEGI there ok.<br><br>\n\nlucky uba\n</span><br><br>\n\n<span class=\"comment\">[ OTU NNEGI = a nasty comment involving one's mother ]</span><br><br>\n\n<span class=\"shc\">\nSeem's not.\n\n</span><br><br>\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "", "author_role": "bait", "body": "OK Lucky you got me there.\n\nObviously I am NOT going to send your fake name and silly scam to the police.\n\nThe cops will just think I am an Idiot.\n\nOTU NNEGI is that your real name?\n\nThat's quite a nice name.
