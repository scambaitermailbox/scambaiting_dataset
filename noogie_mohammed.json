I presume you know this guy but his email address is iamindada@yahoo.com. He tells me now that the money is still in Benin with Global Express but he is in Lagos. Now you're telling me that the money is in Nigeria. Can you understand how this might be a little confusing for me?\n<br /> <br /> \nThere's something else - I heard from the first attorney, Obinna, and he's telling me to send money to him by Western Union. General, Gadyukina is a small, remote village in the Ural mountains of the Russian far east. There is no Western Union here and the nearest one is in Irkutsk which is an 8-hour drive from here. There's no way I can get there before Saturday. I could possibly get there sometime around the middle of next week but if there's a 4-day limit on when we can do this then we have a big problem. I asked Barrister Dada for a bank account that I could do a wire transfer to.\n<br /> <br /> \nSo I'm very confused about the logistics of this deal and I'm beginning to think that we're not going to be able to pull this off.<br /> <br /> \n\nLewd \n</div>\n</div>\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "(PASS CODE: 77KA19).
