Due to poor management of the company, and coupled with the war that just ended in my country and for the fact that I am so dedicated to church activities, I realized that I am too young to manage a large company of that type and most of the director have already began to divert the net profit being generated from the company. \nI therefore arrange with my father's lawyer and sold the entire company to Mr. Alan Foster from Poland at the price of US $5, 600, 000, (Five Million Six Hundred Thousand Dollars).

I'm\nparticularly interested in helping refugees from Africa as that is\nwhere my ancestors originated before they were taken as slaves to\nAmerica some time in the early 1800's.<br><br>\nI believe that Bob's told you I'm happy to authorise the Foundation to\nmake a grant available.
