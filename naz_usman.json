BUKARI AHMEDAFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (ADBBILL AND EXCHANGE DEPARTMENT,OFFSHORE OFFICE,OUAGADOUGOU,BURKINA-FASO.\n\nDearest, I am the Bill and Exchange(assistant) Manager of the Africa development Bank, DR. BUKARI AHMED. In my department I discovered an abandoned sum of USD$7.300.000 (SEVEN MILLION THREE HUNDRED U.S.A DOLLARS). In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his wife and two children in July 2000 in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased, as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him in the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I in my department now decided to make this business proposals to you and release the money to you as next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed/abandoned for long time, the money will be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner in this transaction is necessary because our late customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 40% of this money will be for you as foreigner partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account,10% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the business and 50% would be for me and my colleague, after which we shall visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank, and send your account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be remitted. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or e-mail the text of the application which you shall retype and fax to our foreign remittance maneger,for easy execution of the transaction. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is 100% hitch-free on both side. As all required arrangement have been made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately. I expect your urgent reply on my email:bukariahmed1@yahoo.frBest regards.\n\nDR.

As a matter of fact, you have raised a very important point and which is of my concern to respond to you in order to proceed. Actually before i contacted you it is very sure that nothing is going to happen to you as you make up your mind to handle this transaction with me. I will also have no trouble at all having this transaction with you. The legitimacy of this transaction is sure which gave me the confidence and heart to contact you.therefore it shouldn't be any problem or difficulty at all if you and your wife have decided to give me your co-operation. If you are prepared to do business with me, here is the details of this transaction you should read it carefully and I will like to inform you that there is no risk in this transaction, the reason why I contacted you in this transaction is because our late customer Mr ABDUL RASAQ HASIN is a foreigner and an indigene of (Burkinabe) can not stand as next of kin to the deceased customer unless a foreigner. The transfer of this fund is not going to take us more than 14 bank working days, if you sincerely give me your co-operation and full support.\nBut for now I want you to be following up every process that I will be giving you so that we can acheive this aim.I want you to assure me of your capability of handling this transfer with trust by giving me the following informations about yourself: \n1) Your age.\n2) Your occupation.\n3)Your identification. \n4) Your direct phone number\nBase on this I will advice you to feel free,for I studied this transaction very well before contacting you for assistance. Well, having served this bank for so many years now and nearing my retirement I deem it necessary to utilise this opportunity of the present unclaimed sum of money in the account sent inconjuction with the first proposal I sent to you to help myself and my family after my retirement through the investment I will establish in your country with my percentage in the transaction. \nThere is no doubt about your eligibility as the legal next of kin to our deceased customer and owner of the account number $286-41732-55, with the following reasons:\n(a)Before the death of our deceased customer his true next of kin was not indicated to the board of directors of the bank because of the top secrecy and confidentiality of the transactions which our late customer transacted with the various governments in West Africa. \n(b)Owning to his failure to indicate his next of kin to the officials of the bank, it is therefore impossible for the board of directors of the bank to verify the next of kin as well as the true heritor of the fund.\n(c)And for the above reasons the managements of the bank authorised me officially as the BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER / AUDTITING AND ACCOUNTING DEPARTMENT of the bank to verify the next of kin to our deceased customer. Therefore, the bank will always abide by my official directions through the official authorisation bestowed on me. And for this reasons you have nothing to fear as your interest and identity will be legally protected.\nNow I will like to use this opportunity to tell you the detail information\u00a1\u00afs concerning our deceased customer. The deceased account holder with our bank was Mr ABDUL RASAQ HASIN, FROM JORDAN National who naturalised here in Burkina Faso for (16) years. \nHe held account number N\u00a1\u00c6 $286-41732-55, with our bank. He died in an air crash with his family . Since his death, this account has been dormant and nobody has applied to our bank for the release of this money to him or her as the next of kin.\nAs the Bill and exchange manager of this bank, I have studied this transaction very carefully and I have noted that there are no risks involved. I am here to protect all your interests in this transaction until this money hits your account. Since I am here I shall be giving you all the developmental information from the bank as soon as this transaction commences. I know that you will not disappoint me when this money gets to your country, I have all my hope in this transaction because I shall soon go on retirement.\n\nIt is however agreed, as the account owner in this deal to allow you 40% of the entire sum as compensation, 50% will be held on trust for me while 10% will be used to defray any incidental charges and cost during the course of the transaction. I am a simple banker whose credibility is still intact and with my maturity and understanding, I promise to give you the best co-operation. \nWe must hurry up with this transaction so that our bank and the government shall not claim and inherit this money because it has over-stayed. After the bank have approve your application as next of kin to our late customer I will fly down to your country for investment with my own share, but I will advise you to keep it as a top secret because no body again knew about this transaction except you and I. \nAwaiting to hear from you urgently,\nBest Regards,\nDr. Bukari Ahmed. \n\nFor the commencement of this transaction in the bank, I advise you to fill and send the below Application to the bank for immediate attention.\n\n\n\nATTN: Dr Ali Aboubaka\nThe Director of Operations\nForeign Remittance Division\nAfrican Dev.
