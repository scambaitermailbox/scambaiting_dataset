My brother, you have nothing to worry about as long as I am here because I am going to make sure everything is ok but you have to be preparing to claim this fund by Tuesday or Wednesday next week before your friend, I dies.\nAs regards your question, the content of the consignment is &pound;45,745,000.00 belonging to you as an\nInvestor of Fidelity Investment Corporation as claimed. More so, you have to write them now letting them know that your area network is very bad and that you have no Fax and that they should forward whatever they want to forward through email as it is the only reliable means there in Australia.

He was operated but just that, as you might know, he is not meant to start eating immediately because he is still in serious pains.

So, i am looking forward to hearing from him as regards that.\nMy brother, I wish to use this opportunity to say a very big thanks to you and who ever made this possible especially the Doctor and most importantly you.\nMy brother, through out today, my in-law was in the Post office as you directed and at the end he was unable to collect the money. So, I know you really want to help me as a friend and even if not for the sake of my cries then for the sake of Lawrence in pains. \nPlease, remember you are the only hope I have for now to pay for the Hospital Bills as well as buying the necessary drugs as prescribed for Lawrence as I have no other person to run to except you and thank God you are always there for me.\nMy brother, Please do me that favor as you have started doing it. Go and call that money back and send it through the Western Union Money Transfer that I gave you if you really wanted to help me as you promised. My condition now is that I cannot leave Lawrence for any reason since all that the Mother does now any time she sees him is to start crying and that is making Lawrence very uncomfortable. So, I have decided to take care of him myself as he wished. He personally asked me to always be with him and you know how dear Lawrence is to me that he would feel better seeing me every seconds and I am keeping the promise to always make sure I am there with him.\nPlease my brother, I know you really wanted to help me and I know as well that I am owing you a lot to pay you back in no short time as you know. Please my brother, complete this help as you promised. I have nothing with me now and your money is lying down somewhere. Please call it back and send it with those details I gave you so that my in-law will collect it as I have earlier explained to you that he is the only person I trust now after you. Please do it for the sake of dieing Lawrence and know that God will never cease to bless you abundantly as He has always done.\nPlease my brother, I am really hoping only on you and God for the survival of my Son, Lawrence and I know that neither of you will disappoint me. \nPlease my brother; I pray that God will keep on blessing you as you do that.\nI await your urgent response of this mail with a good result to save Lawrence and help me too.

My brother, I know you have really tried for me to help my Son but i don't seem to know where the problem is actually coming from, So If you cannot meet up with giving me the real information to collecting this Money from the <span class=\"wu\">Moneygram</span> and you cannot send it through <span class=\"wu\">Western Union</span>, then i think you should forget about it.<br />\nThis is exactelly why i told you that i don't trust <span class=\"wu\">Moneygram</span> and you can see it now.
