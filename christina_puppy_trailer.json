God bless her.  I pray Rove can bless her too.\n \nJust minutes ago, the hospital phoned, to tell me there has been no change to Louisa, but also to say that this is rather good for her, at least she has not gone dead.  Small things sometimes happen to good people and other times, and sometimes good things happen to small people and to other people if they have the faith of Rove Live.\n \nThank you so very much for sending your condolences, that means so much to me, since I'm left here on my own to look after my sister, who is looking after the 'things' for a friend, who has gone to look after her sister, who has had a heart attack.  Quite frankly, I'm a bit pissed off, as they have left me in this big house, with lots of cash, but it's so far from freaking anywhere, I can't even get a bottle of scotch delivered within 6 hours, gladly that was solved.  I now have amplitty of bottles of Scotch--anality variety, and some Irish whiskers, of the viginal varity.\n \nOh, Oh an English Bulldog would please Louisa's friend Gerty, to the nines of time in the time square in London many times over.  I promise I will not tell.   I'm very good at keeping secrets, I only ever tell one person at a time.  Bob will get everything set up at Homer to make the little boy bulldog happy.  We can't wait for his arrival.  I'm jumping up and down, and nearly peeing meself over the thought.  Of course, a lot of that has to do with my age.  An old person should be able to be happy without peeing their pants, but God does not give us the good bladders.  She gives them to the young persons.\n \nI know I'm asking things difficult for you now, but British Bulldogs, having stipulated veterinary regulations, for import and sale to within Austraile, do need X rey certification, and any dogs bred within Australia, need same MRI films and Zactitulated X rays because the breed seems to enjoy the company of the much maligned ferret, much to breeders disgust, but they just can't seem to resist cuddling and snoozling the ferret.  It might be a problem for the breeders but not for us, we are so happy to be getting a Bulldog.  So, is the puppy coming with Zactiulated X ray films???   Please let me know as any puppy being subjected to the\nZactiulated X ray films is also being subjected to the Australian Brain Worm, by accident.  I know the X rays are expensive, so please permit me to pay for them.\nThe worm transposes  zionsepticaly within the X raY and can cause shooting poos in the new puppy and usually, the poo happens before the diagnoses.

God bless her.  I pray Rove can bless her too.<br /><br />\n \nJust minutes ago, the hospital phoned, to tell me there has been no change to Louisa, but also to say that this is rather good for her, at least she has not gone dead.  Small things sometimes happen to good people and other times, and sometimes good things happen to small people and to other people if they have the faith of Rove Live.<br /><br />\n \nThank you so very much for sending your condolences, that means so much to me, since I'm left here on my own to look after my sister, who is looking after the 'things' for a friend, who has gone to look after her sister, who has had a heart attack.  Quite frankly, I'm a bit pissed off, as they have left me in this big house, with lots of cash, but it's so far from freaking anywhere, I can't even get a bottle of scotch delivered within 6 hours, gladly that was solved.  I now have amplitty of bottles of Scotch--anality variety, and some Irish whiskers, of the viginal varity.<br /><br />\n \nOh, Oh an English Bulldog would please Louisa's friend Gerty, to the nines of time in the time square in London many times over.  I promise I will not tell.   I'm very good at keeping secrets, I only ever tell one person at a time.  Bob will get everything set up at Homer to make the little boy bulldog happy.  We can't wait for his arrival.  I'm jumping up and down, and nearly peeing meself over the thought.  Of course, a lot of that has to do with my age.
