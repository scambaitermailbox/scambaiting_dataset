I feel that so much of import has transpired between us, and in such a short space of time, that we are almost good friends. I am so pleased, as we often feel here quite strongly how important it is to maintain good relations with chaps from the former colonies.\n\nI have just got back to the palace after a bison shoot in Scotland, and have yet to catch up with all the bits and bobs of news that has happened while I have been away. My butler Scones has spent a difficult half hour or so manhandling the carcass of a beast bagged from off the top of the Landrover and into the kitchens here for proper butchering, but now that my supervision is no longer required, I feel that I can give this business my fullest attention. I need to check with Mr Barrymore, once they are all awake in Australia naturally, that everything you have sent (?)  is in order and then I am certain we can proceed without any further ado. I know that Cardigan is especially keen to get done on this project now as several of his men are required for duties elsewhere, some native rioting somewhere. There is no doubt that this little charitable donation of ours has proved quite a diversion what with one thing or another! Incidentally Cardigan asked me, over Sherry in the Magoo Room a short while ago, if you would like a Light Horse Brigade beret as a little souvenir of this connnection? He can easily have one chucked in, with honorary badge naturally, before the door is finally shut on the container.\n\nYou ask about obtaining a visa for a couple of your friends. Well, although it would be highly irregular, I feel that perhaps rules may be bent a little in this situation. If you wish to pass on their details, I shall be happy to forward them with a personal recommendation to Sir Marmite Luny-Bins, the Regis Chamberlain here, who would be responsible for any extraordinary visa grants of this course. Of course you may wish to contact him yourself with all the details, the matter is up to you. But please keep any application brief as he is a busy man, and you will understand Marmite does not like to be spread too thinly.\n\nAs far as political leaders in the UK I am afraid I try and remain slightly above the fractious nature of party politics. We see quite a few of the parliamentary johnnies at the palace as it happens on one pretext or another, all about will the Queen be signing this and that bill, or does she he have a view on this and that appointment, committee squabbles and what not, so all in all the lot of them become rather tiring after a while. I suppose given a choice, I would have the softest spot for Lars van Deferens, the leader of the UK Independence party, as at least he pipes a different tune when it come to it. Globalisation and such things are beyond me, I am afraid although my niece Candice seems to take an interest. Things were much simpler when we had troops stationed around the world, running things here and there and generally looking after the natives. Such issues never seemed to arise then. I blame the communists.\n\nAnyhow, no doubt we shall be talking again soon. I hope the thanks giving ceremony goes well. Durings Matins at Smegaroon Catherdral this morning I must admit I nearly fell asleep, this during the sermon by the Rev Paisley, but I put this down to the tiredness after the hunt.\n\nWarm regards\nMARGARET\nHer Royal Highness Princess Margaret VC, Duchess of Great Tesco,", "raw": "<hr>\n\n<span class=\"pm\">HRH Princess Margaret</span><br><br><span class=\"ast\">\n\nMar 19<br><br>\n\nDear Brant (if I may?)<br><br>\n\nWhat splendid news!

In regards to your enquiry about preferred national cuisine, outside of traditional British fare I suppose I enjoy Irish food the most I remember how absoloutely delicious, only a few weeks ago, was the poteen and guiness I had whilst on a royal visit to Blarney. It quite cheered me up on a cold day and Sir Marmite had seconds. I also have been known to order frogs legs at the Savoy, as the chef there does a quite remarkable French menu, with absolutely none of the ridiculous franco-frippery poor old Chirac puts out at his banquets, I must say. I can't help you with the distance to Edinburgh - why on earth do you want to know? Don't you fellows have atlases? - although I am sure you can look it up. While I do, as it happens, make frequent trips to the city (to see my brother the Thane of Cawdor), this is either by plane or in more leisurely moments I just let my chaffeur take care of the mileage calculations if we need take the BMW for a jaunt.\n\nThe role of the Commonwealth is very important, as you suggest, in assisting in world peace. So many of the chappies in the former colonies have little or no idea of decent government, what with all the rioting, and scams or politicians in and out like revolving doors going on out there, all we can do to help, in our modest way, must be a good thing, don't you think? One reason why we want to see you dealt with so comprehensively.\n\nNow, on to more important matters and I must admit I am alarmed that you have apparently not yet sent your Oath to Mr Barrymore, as he assures me that certainly none has been received. Do have the correct address for his office? Please take the time and trouble to resend it asap, as we need to get the modalities on the move now.

Not good for image at all, that sort of thing.\n\nI am naturally delighted that things are do so well at your end and let us hope matters proceed just as smoothly here.
