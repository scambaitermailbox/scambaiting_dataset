I remember placing a small ad some months ago in the Smegaroon Field & Blood Sports Review but thought nothing came of it. I am not sure we would be right for each other though, as I am 67 and have some disabilities due to combat against the uprising natives back in the day. Do you have an interest in fine brandy, golf and blue chip investments, perchance? That would be a fine thing to discover.\n\n\nAnyway thank you for writing to this lonely old rich CEO.
