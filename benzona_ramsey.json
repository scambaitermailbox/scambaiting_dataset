You possess a doctorate - I'm assuming you're not a medical person - and you hold a high position in Homeland Security.  I probably am correct to surmise that academically, you're been around the block, so to speak.  \n\nYour message, though, reminds me slightly of a Talmudic work.  Bravo to you, Dr. Mrs. Owen.  Have you ever heard of, or read the Talmud?  \n\nParadoxically, it is both a living document and a historical archive, containing all the history behind and precedents outlining how my people ethically and morally live their daily lives.  As a religious lay leader, the Talmud is my lifeblood. Reading the Talmud takes years of study and hard work.  The language is a mixture of Hebrew and Aramaic, and usually the text is not written in complete sentences or in the common grammatical parlance of Babylonia, so at times seems a little bit incomprehensible to an outsider.  \n\nLet me give you an example.  It was normally forbidden in ancient times to light a fire in the Temple immediately before the Sabbath, because it might incite others to stoke the flames, which is a transgression, except under certain conditions, depending on how much of the fire was lit.  On this note, the text from Tractate Shabbat p. 20a translates as: \"...A single wood.  Rav said: Most of its thickness. And some report it to most of its circumference. Rav Pappa said: Therefore we need most of its thickness and we need most of its circumference.\"  \n\nWhat does this really mean?  \"Regarding a single, thick piece of wood, Rav said: The fire must penetrate most of its thickness before the Sabbath in order for us not to commit a transgression.  And some report Rav's view as being: The fire must catch on to most of its outer circumference.  Rav Pappa said: Therefore, since it is unclear which \"most\" is needed, we need that the fire penetrate most of its thickness and we need that it should catch on to most of its circumference before the Sabbath in order to avoid a transgression.\"\n\nSo from years of reading Talmud, I've gotten quite good at interpreting the cryptic.  Sorting the wheat from the chaff in your message though has me a little stumped.  Every sentence, in fact, has some mystical undertone.  I'm fascinated, more than anything. Allow me to attempt an exegesis of your missive.  Please correct any mistakes in my interpretation.\n\"I am very happy that you asked me a question\" - Something good has happened in your life.  A new child, perhaps? A promotion?  Unseasonably beautiful weather?  Found $50 at the side of the road?  \n\n\"I some conscious and curious client's\" - Indeed unless you were a hypnotherapist, I would gainly suspect most of your clients should be conscious.  I'll grant you the missing verb, as busy people don't have time for verbs.  I oftentimes forget direct objects in my sentences, leaving the reader very.  \"Client's\" though is an odd choice of words; Civil servants from America and the UK generally don't refer to citizens as \"clients\".  Your background is either in finance, or you're not native to the US.  Am I right?\n\n\"as it will make you to understand vividly the importance and needs of what you are supposed to do before you do it\" - Do most of your \"client's\" do things without understanding what they do?  I pity the state of anyone doing a wire transfer anywhere in the world.\n\"Your fund wire transfer came from the JP Morgan Chase Bank New York after is approval to the Standard Chartered Bank for further credit to your nominated bank account in Israel\" - although that ninny Bolton suggested the fund comes from the Bank of Africa\n\"and the collaboration of the Homeland Security and the British Government is in prevention of crimes and terrorism which you are much aware off\" - In fact I'm not aware off  US Homeland Security operating in the UK openly.  I understand the two governments working in international collaboration, but still did not realise that the US opened up a divisional office in the UK.  Where is it located? How long has it been there?  Who is in charge?\n\"Over years now the British Government and the US Government as been in collaboration in poverty alleviation program\" - What have been the results of this collaboration?  Where is the poverty being alleviated?  In the UK or the US?  And why is there a need for collaboration?  Surely the US needs no help from the UK in domestic issues?\n\"bringing the fight against biological cum nuclear weapons in the United Nations.\" - I've always had a sneaking suspicion why the UN has been so anti-Israel over the past 60 years.  I didn't realise it was because of the biological cum nuclear weapons stashed there!  Israel must have cottoned on early.  Where are the weapons?  UN headquarters in New York?  \n\"The hand to hand work of the British Government and our government hasbrought this security body the Inter Pool\" - no doubt leaving them drowning in paperwork (nyuk nyuk)\n\"the Scotland Yard the US Homeland Security FBI/CIA which strengthens the power of security and thisadvanced system\" - of what exactly?
