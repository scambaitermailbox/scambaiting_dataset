You are so sweet to invite me to come down and visit you but at this time of year it is impossible for me to do that.  Leaving now would give the Keebler Elves the chance to gain a foothold in my business and we can't allow that.  I didn't get to be this wealthy by allowing tiny footprints all over my back.  Please proceed with option number 2.  I do hope you understand my position about the upcoming holidays and not being able to leave.  The last thing I would want is for you to think I am not being honest.  Tell me, are you familiar with the American holidays?   Do you celebrate any holidays of your own?  Perhaps we could strike a business arrangement to help you out with any confectionaries you may need.  Please let me know if that is possible and we can arrange for whatever it is you have coming.  With all my years of experience, I can give you everything that you need to have.<br /><br />\n\nRegards,<br /><br />\n\nBetty\n</div>\n</div>\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "2008-10-17 00:00", "subject": "LEGAL PROCESS (2)", "author_role": "scam", "body": "FIN ATTORNEY & PARTNERS LAW FIRM\n1ST FLOOR LOT 12, BLK.L, \nJALAN PADAS COMPLEX, 88000 KOTA KINBALU, SABAH, MALAYSIA. \nWelcome to Finlawfirm Patners & Attorneys \n\n\n\n\nATTENTION:Betty Crocker, \n\nMY OFFICE WILL UNDERTAKE TO FULFILL ALL PROTOCOLS AND DOCUMENTARY REQUIREMENTS ON YOUR BEHALF.
