I do assure you that you and I stand to gain enormously from this deal if we both receive the cooperation desired for the success of transaction of this nature. I choose to write to you from this e-mail account as part of measures taken to safeguard the operation.\n\n\nAs I stated in my first email to you my name is 2nd Lt. Jessica Colby McBride. I am a US citizen and was born in Queens County, New York in 1976. As a young girl I was a curious child. I lived in fantasy world half the time, and the other half I lived in a real fantasy world, the noisy streets of the upper west side Manhattan, NYC. After obtaining my qualification as a nurse I enlisted in the army in 1998. This year marks my 12th year in service. I am currently a member of the US Army Special Operations Command (USASOC) Medical Team. I am a qualified nurse by training. In my years in the medical team, I have witnessed a lot of sad, horrific, mean and wicked action perpetuated by terrorist, religious bigots and militants. I am working on a book that would detail my experience when I eventually retire.\n\n\nI have received several postings while here in Iraq. It is the most recent posting that has landed me a good fortune which I intend to share with you. After about 2 months in the new house I was allocated I noticed that there was a hidden door in the wardrobe that leads to an underground cellar. What I discovered in the underground cellar was quite revealing. I discovered containers stashed with United States Dollars. Ever since this discovery I have been unable to concentrate as I have been confused on the exact course of action to take. I have informed no one. I do not intend to inform the authorities. I intend to help myself. I have been weighing a lot of options on how best to secure these funds on my own, without the knowledge of the authorities.\n\n\nAs you must be aware, American troops in Iraq have served with distinction. There is strict observance of rules and ordinances. There is also a systematic probing and investigation of all troops to make sure that there are no unlawful activities. We are trained to report any suspicious movement involving anybody that might tarnish the image of our country. Because of this singular fact it has been very difficult for me to tell any one nor spend a dollar out of the money. I have tried to carry on as if all is well with me.\n\n\nI have decided to act after two months because I just found out that I might soon be re-deployed out of my present location to the Helmand Province in Afghanistan. If this happens without me taking action on the money I have discovered I will forever live to regret my inaction as it is an opportunity for me to be financially solvent for ever. I need your help in order to make this a reality.\n\n\nI have a patient who is a diplomat. I have known him for over a year. We are fond of each other. I have had extensive discussions with him on helping me transport some goods abroad. He has agreed in principle to help me. The reason why I am bringing a diplomat into it is that diplomats have immunity. Whatever they carry or transport across countries are covered by diplomatic immunity. It cannot be searched or opened by anybody be it customs, police or secret service. The goods are often covered with diplomatic seal. The goods will get to its destination without problems. Please be informed that I will not tell the diplomat the real content of the containers. The diplomat will deliver the containers to you.\n\n\nUsing the diplomat makes this process completely risk free. The worst scenario is that the diplomat will be sent back with the baggage if there is any suspicion. He cannot be arrested, the goods cannot be confiscated. He will merely be returned to the country he is coming from.\nThis is where you come in. Your duties or responsibility will be to receive the containers which contains the money from the diplomat. You are to keep it safely until I come to meet with you were we will discuss the modalities for sharing and engage in partnership while investing.\n\n\nI need someone I can rely on. Someone who is frank and honest. Someone who will agree to assist me and be involved throughout the period the process will last. Someone I can count on to act as a genuine and an interested party. I want you to go through this email careful and get back to me. We can begin to discuss further details once I hear from you through email.\n\n\nFor utmost confidentiality I will appreciate that all our communication are done through email. It will be dangerous to communicate through the telephone as phones are often wired or tapped, calls often traced or intercepted. This is one of the security precautions that we must take.\nIf you are interested in been part of this process I will require that you send my a photo of yourself and tell me a little about you. I am attaching some photos of myself in this mail.\n\n\nBest regards,\nJessica.", "raw": " <div id=\"record\">\n\t<div id=\"char\"><span class=\"jm\">Jessica McBride</span>\n\t<p class=\"comment\">She finds time.</p>\n\t<p class=\"comment\">This is standard \"Three Kings\" Iraq-format Lad stuff. \n\tSoldier has found money, let's you and me share it, etc.</p>\n\t</div>\n\t<div id=\"dialog\" class=\"st\"> \n\n<p>\nHi Lewd,\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThanks for your response to my email.

Hope you doing good? Its nice to hear from you. Your writing style is interested. I thank you once again for your prompt response to my last e-mail and for letting me know more about you. In my last email I explained the modalities that would be involved in making a success out of this exercise. The reason why I have taken this route is quite obvious. The best way to get this money across to you is by using the diplomat. Any other method will bring us into the open. You must prepare to receive the cash in containers that would be delivered by the diplomat. You must also ensure a safe keeping of the cash until my arrival to meet with you.\nLike I hinted in my last e-mail, using the diplomat is the best option for the success of the operation. Any other will will blow our cover and expose us. I have found a way to properly conceal the money in crates amongst personal items of clothing, books, artifacts and rugs. The material I will use for wrapping the cash will make the cash virtually undetected by scanner at the airport. Also, since a diplomat will be accompanying the containers they will be yellow tagged and thus exempt from physical inspection. This is in line with conventions on the treatment of diplomats traveling from one territory to another. I want an assurance from you that you will help to receive this money. I also want you to assure me that like me you will be willing to sacrifice your time if required. Also most importantly you will follow instructions until you receive the money.\n\n\nAs I have already informed you it took me time to plan this transaction. If we all do what is expected of us we shall surely succeed. You have to be committed. This is also very important. If for instance the diplomat arrives an airport close to your location and wants you to meet him, you should be prepared to travel to meet with him at short notice. This means that you might be required to spend your personal money on transportation, accommodation and contigencies. It will be absurd for you to be unable to go and meet with him at the airport on account of this. You therefore have to be ready. You must have some funds available for this sort of expense.\nI have avoided discussing the amount involved because I wanted to hear from you and be sure that you are interested. The total amount I have discovered is US$8,757,500. It is in United States Dollars and it took me a lot of time to count the bills. I have checked that they are genuine and not counterfeits. I have attached here a photo of the money after counting and stacking the bills. The money that was found does not belong to the American Government neither does it belong to the Iraqi Government. Intel revealed that the house where I found the stash was formerly used by a Shiite Cleric known for anti-American views and backed by the Iranian Government. My guess is that it probably belongs to this group and it was money meant for funding attacks on US and coalition troops waging war against terror in Iraq. As you do know, thousands of American families have lost their loved ones to the war.\n\n\nI am not a moralist but I have seen enough of human carnage and misery occasioned by war to make me a practical person. I reason that since the money was meant to fund militants who kill and maim us I can leave with my conscience if I take it. This rationalization is not justification. I am pragmatic enough to have gone beyond that point. You can judge me if you want but I have no regrets about what I intend to do.\n\n\nOn the sharing of the money. I want to leave this open for discussions between us. What is your suggestion on the sharing of the money. What will you take to be a part of this transaction? We need to agree on this before we can further this process.\n\n\nHaving gone through my emails what do you think about the entire plan? When planning a transaction you have to take into cognizance anything that might happen that is unforeseen. I will not like the process held up for any reason. You have to tell me your ability to take charge when it is your turn to do so. Are you committed to the realization of the objective of this operation? Do you have any suggestions or additions to make the plan more concrete? I am open to any suggestions. We can incorporate any idea at this stage of the process.\n\n\nA quick response will be appreciated.\n\n\nRegards,\nJessica.", "raw": " <div id=\"record\">\n\t<div id=\"char\"><span class=\"jm\">Jessica McBride</span>\n\t<p class=\"comment\">Better writing than usual, although still scamalicious.</p>\n\t</div>\n\t<div id=\"dialog\" class=\"st\"> \n\n<p>\nHi Lewd,\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHow are you today?

I AM STILL IN ORLANDO. THE LAST 24 HOURS HAS BEEN DIFFICULT FOR ME HERE. WE WERE FINALLY ABLE TO RESOLVE ALL ISSUES YESTERDAY. I MET WITH SECURITY OFFICIALS FOR CLOSE TO 3 HOURS WHERE THE ISSUES RAISED BY THE US CUSTOMS WERE EXTENSIVELY DISCUSSED AND RESOLVED. THE MAIN GROUSE IS THAT I OBTAINED DUTY WAIVERS AT THE BAGHDAD AIRPORT IN IRAQ WHICH WERE NOT DUE ME. I WAS MADE TO UNDERSTAND THAT I AM ONLY ENTITLED TO WAIVERS ONLY IF I AM AN ASSIGNMENT FROM MY HOME GOVERNMENT. THEY FOUND OUT THAT I WAS ON A PRIVATE MISSION AND AS SUCH I CANNOT ENJOY THESE WAIVERS. THE US CUSTOMS WERE INFORMED AND I WAS TAKEN OUT, QUARANTINED AND DELAYED.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAFTER OBTAINING AN APOLOGY FROM ME I WAS CLEARED BY THE US CUSTOMS AND WILL BE ALLOWED TO GO. I WAS ASKED TO PAY ABOUT US$8,700 WHICH REPRESENTS THE DUTIES I AM SUPPOSED TO PAY AND A PENALTY CHARGE. I AM SUPPOSED TO PAY THIS AMOUNT BEFORE I AM ALLOWED TO DEPART THE US WITH THE CONTAINERS. THE CONTAINERS HAVE BEEN IMPOUNDED PENDING WHEN I AM ABLE TO PAY THE FEES. I WAS GIVEN A CLEARANCE PAPER DULY SIGNED IN THE PRESENCE OF ALL PARTIES AFTER WE HAVE AGREED. THE US GOVERNMENT WILL RECEIVE THIS SUM AND TRANSMIT TO THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAT THIS JUNCTURE ALL I HAVE ON ME ONLY ABOUT US$5,850 ON ME. I AM TRYING TO SEE WHAT I CAN DO FROM HERE BUT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT. I AM TRYING TO SOURCE THE ADDITIONAL FUNDS REQUIRED WHICH AMOUNTS TO $2,850. THIS IS SO THAT I CAN CONTINUE MY JOURNEY TO IRKUTSK. I DESIRE TO LEAVE ORLANDO TONIGHT. I DO NOT WANT ANY FURTHER DELAY. THIS TRIP HAS TAKEN A LOT FROM ME ALREADY. I DO NOT WANT TO STAY LONGER THAN NECESSARY.<br />\nI HAVE CONTACTED JESSICA AND HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY RESPONSE FROM HER YET. I RECALL SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE WILL BE ON SPECIAL ASSIGNMENT FROM TODAY AND MIGHT BE UNABLE TO ACCESS HER E-MAIL REGULARLY. I AM IN A FIX RIGHT NOW AND IN DIRE NEED OF YOUR HELP. WHATEVER YOU CAN DO TO GET ME OUT OF THIS SITUATION WILL BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.<br />\nI LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR PROMPT AND POSITIVE RESPONSE.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAIDAN P. F.
