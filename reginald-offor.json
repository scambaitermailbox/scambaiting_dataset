The varmint\neven fed a few choice tidbits to Samsung, our pet\ngoat! I found the chewed corners of envelopes and such\nlittering the ground as evidence of the foul deed. I\nnever cease to be amazed at the audacity of this\ncreature. But as you can see by the photo of Dustin\nthat I've attached, he does have a mischievous air\nabout him, don't you agree?\n\nI've tried to salvage the mail that Dustin hid in the\nwoods, but all that remains is a soggy mess of pulp\ndue to the unseasonally heavy rains this summer. I\neven attempted (foolishly, in retrospect) to prise one\nhalf-eaten specimen from Samsung's mouth, but the\nobstinate creature wasn't having any of it and\nseverely winded me with a well placed kick to the\nsolar plexus.

In fact, I was right<br>\nthis very moment composing an e-mail to you when yours<br>\narrived. I'm deeply concerned that I haven't heard<br>\nanything from the bank for nearly a week. I realise<br>\nthat it must take a while to process such a<br>\nsubstantial transfer, but they've had 5 working days<br>\nnow...<br>\n<br>\nDear god, I hope they didn't make the mistake of<br>\nwriting to 27 Roger's Yew Lane again. I've told them<br>\nseveral times not to do that! You see, I have finally<br>\ndiscovered the means by which the post has been<br>\ndisappearing. As you know, I had for a long time<br>\nsuspected that my wife, the feisty wench, had been<br>\nselectively filtering my mail, and was sequestering<br>\nanything she deemed to be of importance. But it turns<br>\nout that my little poppet is innocent after all.<br>\nIndeed, it was she who caught the true culprit - our<br>\npet orangutan, Dustin! She espied Dustin one morning<br>\nlast week as he casually gathered the post from inside<br>\nthe front door, scurried out to the back garden, and<br>\nproceeded to hide various bits of it all over the<br>\nextensive wooded area behind our house. The varmint<br>\neven fed a few choice tidbits to Samsung, our pet<br>\ngoat! I found the chewed corners of envelopes and such<br>\nlittering the ground as evidence of the foul deed. I<br>\nnever cease to be amazed at the audacity of this<br>\ncreature. But as you can see by the photo of Dustin<br>\nthat I've attached, he does have a mischievous air<br>\nabout him, don't you agree?<br>\n<br>\nI've tried to salvage the mail that Dustin hid in the<br>\nwoods, but all that remains is a soggy mess of pulp<br>\ndue to the unseasonally heavy rains this summer. I<br>\neven attempted (foolishly, in retrospect) to prise one<br>\nhalf-eaten specimen from Samsung's mouth, but the<br>\nobstinate creature wasn't having any of it and<br>\nseverely winded me with a well placed kick to the<br>\nsolar plexus. I'm afaid that just like my poor goat, I<br>\nam also reaching the end of my tether!<br>\n<br>\nIn any event, I'm copying this e-mail to Dr. Adams at<br>\nthe bank to make him aware of the situation. Please,<br>\nOffor and Dr. Adams - DO NOT send any more post to my<br>\nhouse. It is vitally important that we conclude this<br>\ntransaction by e-mail or fax!
