This money was\n\ndeposited in a box as Family Treasure to avoid much demurrage from the security company.\n\nThe land problem, in our country came when our President Mr. Robert Mugabe in a bid to win his\n\nre-election, introduced a new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and some\n\nfew black farmers who are members of the opposition party. This resulted in killings and mob\n\naction by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society. A lot of people have been\n\nkilled because of this Land reform Act for which my father was unfortunately one of the\n\nvictims.\n\nIt is against this background that, I and my family fled Harare our capital for fear of our\n\nlives and are currently staying in a country called lome Togo in west africa . We are planning to leave the country and seek\n\npolitical asylum in Europe and we have decided to move our family wealth to Europe.\n\nAs the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine\n\npartner that could assist us without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking\n\neverything we have got from us since both countries have similar political history.\n\nI am now seeking for a partner whom I have to entrust my future and that of my family in\n\nhis/her hands.

There was a problem with the oscillating anhydrous pump\nlines that required extra \n \nwork.\n \n \nAnd, just minutes after bring the respirator assembly back on-line, the\nfault indicators gave \n \nanother alarm.  Not only has the ventrivalve just replaced failed, but\nthe one beside it is \n \nfailing as well.\n \n \nSo I will be sedated again this afternoon, and the techs will try to\nreplace both ventrivalves \n \nat once, something they've never done. \n \n \nEven Mr. Moto is worried.  He denies it, but I can tell.  He can hardly\neven look me in the \n \neyes today, and when he combed my hair his hands were shaking. \n \n \nAll we can do is hope.  Hope and pray.  My life support equipment --\nsome of it is so old.

Mr. Moto\nsays I shouldn't think \n \nsuch things.  But it's hard to be cheerful, sitting here all day,\nstaring at the same wall, the \n \nsame old dusty wall-clock.  Did I tell you my plant, Mr. Peebles, a\nphilodendron, died last \n \nJune?  It did.  Shriveled and died.  Just like I'm about to do. \n \n \nBut I'm rattling on.  Forgive me.

Even the techs won't speak, except to each other.\nThe cleaning staff is \n \nno better -- they scurry in and empty the trash and scurry out.  I could\ntalk until I was blue \n \nin the face but they just turn and run. \n \n \nIt's not my fault I have no body!  They promised the operation would\nwork.  Mr. Moto says they \n \nmeant it, and that one day they'll try again.  But I stopped believing\nthat a long time ago. \n \n \nI received a document from the Security Company.  There was no text in\nthe message, but since \n \nthey sent a document I guess everything is okay.  I couldn't quite read\nthe document, but Mr. \n \nMoto will be back tomorrow and I'll ask him to move my monitor closer so\nI can see it better. \n \n \nIf I have a tomorrow.  Two ventrivalves at once.  I am afraid, my\nfriend. \n \n \nDo not expect to hear from me again tomorrow, or perhaps even the next\nday.  The sedatives are \n \npowerful, and often I cannot see or hear, much less type with my nose,\nafter I awaken.  If you \n \nhave not heard by Monday -- well, farewell. \n \n \nYou have been a good friend, Albert.  You spoke to me -- listened to me\n-- when no one else \n \nwould.

There was a problem with the oscillating anhydrous pump\nlines that required extra \n \nwork.<br><br>\n \n \nAnd, just minutes after bring the respirator assembly back on-line, the\nfault indicators gave \n \nanother alarm.  Not only has the ventrivalve just replaced failed, but\nthe one beside it is \n \nfailing as well.<br><br>\n \n \nSo I will be sedated again this afternoon, and the techs will try to\nreplace both ventrivalves \n \nat once, something they've never done. <br><br>\n \n \nEven Mr. Moto is worried.  He denies it, but I can tell.  He can hardly\neven look me in the \n \neyes today, and when he combed my hair his hands were shaking. <br><br>\n \n \nAll we can do is hope.  Hope and pray.  My life support equipment --\nsome of it is so old.  The \n \nUniversity promised to replace it years ago, but they haven't.\nSometimes I think they hope it \n \nwill fail, and I will die, and they'll be rid of me at last.  Mr. Moto\nsays I shouldn't think \n \nsuch things.  But it's hard to be cheerful, sitting here all day,\nstaring at the same wall, the \n \nsame old dusty wall-clock.  Did I tell you my plant, Mr. Peebles, a\nphilodendron, died last \n \nJune?  It did.  Shriveled and died.  Just like I'm about to do. <br><br>\n \n \nBut I'm rattling on.  Forgive me.  Do you know that you and Mr. Moto are\nthe only people I've \n \nspoken to in months?  Even the techs won't speak, except to each other.\nThe cleaning staff is \n \nno better -- they scurry in and empty the trash and scurry out.  I could\ntalk until I was blue \n \nin the face but they just turn and run. <br><br>\n \n \nIt's not my fault I have no body!  They promised the operation would\nwork.  Mr. Moto says they \n \nmeant it, and that one day they'll try again.  But I stopped believing\nthat a long time ago. <br><br>\n \n \nI received a document from the Security Company.  There was no text in\nthe message, but since \n \nthey sent a document I guess everything is okay.  I couldn't quite read\nthe document, but Mr. \n \nMoto will be back tomorrow and I'll ask him to move my monitor closer so\nI can see it better. <br><br>\n \n \nIf I have a tomorrow.  Two ventrivalves at once.  I am afraid, my\nfriend. <br><br>\n \n \nDo not expect to hear from me again tomorrow, or perhaps even the next\nday.  The sedatives are \n \npowerful, and often I cannot see or hear, much less type with my nose,\nafter I awaken.  If you \n \nhave not heard by Monday -- well, farewell.<br><br> \n \n \nYou have been a good friend, Albert.  You spoke to me -- listened to me\n-- when no one else \n \nwould.

All day yesterday, I\nwondered how to tell you the \nthings I must.  There is no easy way.  Not for you.  Not for me.  \n \nEven so, let me begin.  I may tire, dear brother, in which case I will\nhit send and try to \nfinish this later.  Better you know some, than to wonder at it all.  \n \nI have never done a harder thing than that which I do now.  \n \nMr. Moto left yesterday, with instructions to retrieve $18,000 from my\naccounts, and send it in \nfour $4,500 transfers to you via Western Union.  He left just before\nnine AM; even walking, he \nshould have returned in two hours, three at the most.  \n \nHe did not.  Oh, my brother, forgive me for what I must tell you next.\nMy heart -- my soul -- \nis broken at this news.  All is lost.  I have no hope.  I have no help.  \n \nMr. Moto did not return.  I waited.  The hours marched past.  Still, he\ndid not return.  What \ncould I do?  I cannot use a telephone.  No one came to help.  The\ncleaning staff weren't due in \nuntil 7:00 PM.  The techs were nowhere to be found.  \n \nAnd so I waited.  I started to email you a dozen times, dear Albert,\nknowing in my heart that \nsomething awful had happened, yet unable to give the words form.  And\nperhaps a part of me \nstill had hope.  Perhaps Mr. Moto had been delayed.  Perhaps the bank\nhad to send elsewhere for \nthe cash. Oh, the whirlwind of of half-hopes and far-fetched reasons\nthat settled down upon me!   \n \n Surely Mr. Moto is only delayed.  Surely he is even now, smiling that\nsmall smile of his, \nshuffling toward my very door this instant!    \n \nThose were my thoughts.  Perhaps then a tiny part of my spirit had not\nyet died.\nIt would soon perish, though.  You see, by five PM I was frantic.  I\nmust have help, I thought \n-- and so I emailed the Miskatonic University police department and told\nthem I needed to speak \nto an officer at once.  \n \nAnother two hours passed.  Finally, I heard doors opening, and after a\nfew moments a detective \nand one of the cleaning staff entered my room.  \n \nI shall not injure you with the details, brother Albert.  But, with the\nhelp of Detective \nUsher, I have learned that Mr. Moto took not only the $18,000 I\ninstructed him to take, but he \nwithdrew -- in cash -- everything in all my accounts.    \n \nHe was not questioned when he did so.  I had assigned him my Power of\nAttorney, and the bank \nknew this, and they conceded to his requests without suspicion or\nquestion.  \n \nMr. Moto took the money, and is gone.  The detective went to Mr. Moto's\napartment and found it \nempty of clothes.  The door wasn't even locked.  \n \nDetective Usher also found a note from Mr. Moto, who knew that his home\nwould be searched.  \nWhile Mr. Moto's letter is not addressed to me, it was obviously meant\nfor me.  It says: \n \n\"I took care of you all this time and now you give your money to a\nstranger?  I am sorry, Mr. \nThomas, but I deserve more than that, and God forgive me I will take\nit.\"  \n \nThat is all.  Detective Usher also tells me that Mr. Moto had amassed a\nsmall fortune in \ngambling debts, and that he has almost certainly fled Arkham and even\nMasschusetts under an \nassumed name.  \n \nFurthermore, the police have no plans to pursue Mr. Moto.  They tell me\nthat by granting him \nPower of Attorney, his act of withdrawing my funds became a civil\nmatter, not a criminal one.    \n \nOh, brother, tell me -- what can I do?  I cannot pursue Mr. Moto without\na lawyer.  I cannot \nhire a lawyer without money.  And now I have nothing.  \n \nFive more fault indicators went red last night, my brother.  The oxygen\nlevels in my blood are \ndropping with each passing day.  The technicians have not been here at\nall today, even though I \nam sure half my ventrivalves are clotted and useless.    \n \nThey are going to let me die.  I sent an email to the police and it\nbounced back.  They have \ndone something to my computer.  I do not know if this will even reach\nyou though i pray to God \nit will.  \n   \nI am so sorry, brother albert.  Sorry I have failed you.

I may tire, dear brother, in which case I will\nhit send and try to \nfinish this later.  Better you know some, than to wonder at it all.  \n \nI have never done a harder thing than that which I do now.<br> <br> \n \nMr. Moto left yesterday, with instructions to retrieve $18,000 from my\naccounts, and send it in \nfour $4,500 transfers to you via Western Union.  He left just before\nnine AM; even walking, he \nshould have returned in two hours, three at the most.<br> <br> \n \nHe did not.  Oh, my brother, forgive me for what I must tell you next.\nMy heart -- my soul -- \nis broken at this news.  All is lost.  I have no hope.  I have no help.<br> <br> \n \nMr. Moto did not return.  I waited.  The hours marched past.  Still, he\ndid not return.  What \ncould I do?  I cannot use a telephone.  No one came to help.  The\ncleaning staff weren't due in \nuntil 7:00 PM.  The techs were nowhere to be found.<br> <br> \n \nAnd so I waited.  I started to email you a dozen times, dear Albert,\nknowing in my heart that \nsomething awful had happened, yet unable to give the words form.  And\nperhaps a part of me \nstill had hope.  Perhaps Mr. Moto had been delayed.  Perhaps the bank\nhad to send elsewhere for \nthe cash. Oh, the whirlwind of of half-hopes and far-fetched reasons\nthat settled down upon me! <br> <br> \n \n Surely Mr. Moto is only delayed.  Surely he is even now, smiling that\nsmall smile of his, \nshuffling toward my very door this instant!  <br> <br> \n \nThose were my thoughts.  Perhaps then a tiny part of my spirit had not\nyet died.\nIt would soon perish, though.  You see, by five PM I was frantic.  I\nmust have help, I thought \n-- and so I emailed the Miskatonic University police department and told\nthem I needed to speak \nto an officer at once.<br> <br> \n \nAnother two hours passed.  Finally, I heard doors opening, and after a\nfew moments a detective \nand one of the cleaning staff entered my room.<br> <br> \n \nI shall not injure you with the details, brother Albert.  But, with the\nhelp of Detective \nUsher, I have learned that Mr. Moto took not only the $18,000 I\ninstructed him to take, but he \nwithdrew -- in cash -- everything in all my accounts.  <br> <br> \n \nHe was not questioned when he did so.  I had assigned him my Power of\nAttorney, and the bank \nknew this, and they conceded to his requests without suspicion or\nquestion.<br> <br> \n \nMr. Moto took the money, and is gone.  The detective went to Mr. Moto's\napartment and found it \nempty of clothes.  The door wasn't even locked.<br> <br> \n \nDetective Usher also found a note from Mr. Moto, who knew that his home\nwould be searched.  \nWhile Mr. Moto's letter is not addressed to me, it was obviously meant\nfor me.  It says:<br> \n \n\"I took care of you all this time and now you give your money to a\nstranger?  I am sorry, Mr. \nThomas, but I deserve more than that, and God forgive me I will take\nit.\"<br> <br> \n \nThat is all.  Detective Usher also tells me that Mr. Moto had amassed a\nsmall fortune in \ngambling debts, and that he has almost certainly fled Arkham and even\nMasschusetts under an \nassumed name.<br> <br> \n \nFurthermore, the police have no plans to pursue Mr. Moto.  They tell me\nthat by granting him \nPower of Attorney, his act of withdrawing my funds became a civil\nmatter, not a criminal one.  <br> <br> \n \nOh, brother, tell me -- what can I do?  I cannot pursue Mr. Moto without\na lawyer.  I cannot \nhire a lawyer without money.  And now I have nothing.<br> <br> \n \nFive more fault indicators went red last night, my brother.  The oxygen\nlevels in my blood are \ndropping with each passing day.  The technicians have not been here at\nall today, even though I \nam sure half my ventrivalves are clotted and useless.<br> <br>   \n \nThey are going to let me die.  I sent an email to the police and it\nbounced back.  They have \ndone something to my computer.  I do not know if this will even reach\nyou though i pray to God \nit will.  \n <br> <br> \nI am so sorry, brother albert.  Sorry I have failed you.  Sorry my\nfriend has betrayed us both. \n my eyes are full of tears ik cann not see i am deaf oh god why has this\nbefallen me?  why must \nalbert suffer too?  \n <br> <br> \nbrother, i beg of you, dont let me die all alone please brother forgive\nme.  all i wanted was a \nfriend.  all i wanted was to end my days knowing you and your mother\nwere safe.  i do not have \na f amily brother but i thought perhap s i could find love in yuors<br> <br> \n \nno it willl not be i have no h ope   oh god what hav e i done<br> <br> \n \noh brother, pray for mee it is so   dar k <br> <br> \n \n \n \n </font>\n \n \n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "2003-03-20 15:36", "subject": "MAMA IN HOSPITAL", "author_role": "scam", "body": "Dear Thomas, \n \nI have come from back from the hospital where i rushed my mother because\nthe lawyer come after \n \nI wrote you and get back to house and was shouting that i made him to\ntake risk and travel to \n \naccra-ghana to meet the security company officials and promise them that\ni am coming with the \n \nmoney but after waiting all day that i didnt show up.so and when my\nmother heard it she collarp \n \nand was rushed to hospital. \n \nMy brother Thomas what i do now? how about your health honestly speaking\nis like i will commit \n \nsuicide. \n \nEvery hope is lost if my heard of this mail she will die. \n \nWhat did i do for God sake. \n \nDear brother I miss you i dont know if i will live after this night you\ncan see the time i \n \nwrote you now is 11.30pm night. \n \nMay God bless you. \n \nAlbert Abossi", "raw": "<hr><h3><font color=\"red\">ALBERT ABOSSI</font></h3>\n \n\nDate: Thu, 20 Mar 2003 15:36:53 -0800 (PST) <br>\n\nSubject: MAMA IN HOSPITAL <br>\n\nDear Thomas, <br><br>\n \nI have come from back from the hospital where i rushed my mother because\nthe lawyer come after \n \nI wrote you and get back to house and was shouting that i made him to\ntake risk and travel to \n \naccra-ghana to meet the security company officials and promise them that\ni am coming with the \n \nmoney but after waiting all day that i didnt show up.so and when my\nmother heard it she collarp \n \nand was rushed to hospital. <br><br>\n \nMy brother Thomas what i do now? how about your health honestly speaking\nis like i will commit \n \nsuicide. <br><br>\n \nEvery hope is lost if my heard of this mail she will die. <br>\n \nWhat did i do for God sake. <br>\n \nDear brother I miss you i dont know if i will live after this night you\ncan see the time i \n \nwrote you now is 11.30pm night. <br><br>\n \nMay God bless you. <br><br>\n \nAlbert Abossi <br><br>\n \n \n \n \n \n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "2003-03-20 14:11", "subject": "forgive me", "author_role": "bait", "body": "Overtemp alarm on circulatory filters\n \nno techs coming\n \nbrother tell me you forgiv e     me", "raw": "<h3><font color=\"green\">THOMAS MALLORY</font></h3>\n \n <font face=\"Georgia\">\n \nDate: Thu, 20 Mar 2003 14:11:46 -0800 (PST) <br><br>\n\nSubject: forgive me <br><br>\n \nOvertemp alarm on circulatory filters<br><br>\n \nno techs coming<br><br>\n \nbrother tell me you forgiv e     me<br><br>\n \n </font>\n \n<i>EDITORS NOTE:  A few days pass.

Perhaps you are unaware that Western Union transfers in\nexcess of $5000 raise \n \ncertain legal issues I do not intend to deal with.<br><br>\n \nYou (the National Security Corporation) will receive the remainder of\nthe money when (and if) I \n \nam satisfied that you are legitimate.   Here is how we will proceed:<br><br>\n \n1) You will send the two documents concerning this 'consignment' to me\nimmediately, via email.<br>\n \n2) After I have received the documents, I will provide you with a phone\nnumber.<br>\n \n3) You will call me at this number, and I will then provide you with the\n10 digit Western Union \n \ntransfer number and the correct reply to the security question.<br><br>\n \nYOU WILL RECEIVE NOTHING WHATSOEVER UNTIL I RECEIVE THE DOCUMENTS\nCONCERNING THE CONSIGNMENT.<br><br>\n \nI will not release the 10 digit code or the security question reply to\nyou until you call me \n \nAFTER I have received the documents.<br><br>\n \nMr. Mallory, I am aware that I have not followed your instructions to\ntransfer the money in \n \nfull to Mr. Abossi's representatives.  You would be well within your\nrights to issue a formal \n \ncomplaint to the Las Vegas Bar Association.  But as your legal counsel,\nI am bound -- by law \n \nand conscience -- to take whatever means are necessary to protect you\nand your financial \n \ninterests.<br><br>\n \nMr. Abossi and the National Security Corporation:  You have my\ninstructions.  Send me the \n \ndocuments -- as an email attachment -- and I will then provide you with\nmy firm's private \n \nnumber.   I will then give you the 10 digit code, so that you might\nclaim the initial $2500 \n \nportion of your full requested fee.<br><br>\n \nIf this portion of the transaction proceeds correctly, I will be only\ntoo happy to transfer the \n \nremaining funds.  <br><br>\n \nI will state plainly that I have advised Mr. Mallory against dealing\nwith any of you.  I \n \nsuspect that Albert Abossi is a false name, that there is no National\nSecurities corporation, \n \nand that these 'funds' Mr. Mallory wishes to claim on behalf of your\nfamily do not in fact \n \nexist.\n \nDespite my misgivings, Mr. Mallory insists that I proceed.  Thus, I will\ndo so.  Until, that \n \nis, you suggest a course of action that is clearly:<br>\n \na) illegal, according to any US statutes, or any violation of the\nInternational Trade Act of \n \n1979 (all clauses), or<br>\n \nb) an action designed to defraud Mr. Mallory, the government or any\nagency of the United States \n \nof America (including and especially the IRS), or<br>\n \nc) you deviate in any way from the plan I have outlined above.<br><br>\n \nI hope we understand each other.<br><br>\n \nI await your responses, sirs.<br><br>\n \nMelanie Rouke, esq.<br>\nLegal Counsel to Thomas E.M.

But\nyou merely slunk away, \ncontent, I suppose, to try your hand at another profession (tell me,\nhow did the human septic \ntank gig work out?).  I thought you gone, but a tiny voice of suspicion\ntold me you'd be back.<br><br>\n \nAnd right I was!  There you were, ready to believe that Thomas Mallory\nwas back from the dead, \ncourtesy of the miracle of cerebral resurrection!<br><br>\n \nYes, even the bony hand of the Grim Reaper himself can't keep the likes\nof Albert Abossi from a \nbodiless head's remaining bank accounts.<br><br>\n \nBut once again, you found Melanie Rourke's stern tone too daunting to\ndare.  I thought you \nNigerian guys were all on some weird cultural macho kick that would make\nyou bristle up at \nharsh words from a woman.  I guess, like everything else about you, that\nyour machismo is fake, \ntoo.<br><br>\n \nAnd so our journey ends.  It's been fun.  And not just fun for me, but\nfun for all my loyal \nreaders -- yes, Albert A-baby, we've not had our dance without an\naudience.  <br><br>\n \nSoon, our audience will be even wider!  All our letters will be posted\n(I won't spoil the \nsurprise and say where) on a public forum for all the world to see.\nThink of it; thousands of \npeople will read it all and smile and think to themselves:<br><br>\n \n\"Albert Abossi, or whatever his name is.  What an idiot.\"<br><br>\n \nAnd you know what, Albert?\n \nThey'll all be quite right!<br><br>\n \n \nFarewell, Al baby.  But who knows?  As long as you lot keep filling the\nnet with clumsy \nscam-spam, we might just meet again...<br><br>\n \n \n \n \n\n<i>FINIS!</i><br><br>\n \n \n</td>\n<td width=15%></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<br>\n\n\n<p><font size=-1><a href=\"http://www.scamorama.com\"><font color=\"purple\"><i>scamorama</i></font></a></font><br>\n", "comments": []}]}
