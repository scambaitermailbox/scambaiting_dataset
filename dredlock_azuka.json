Dredlock</b></font> <br><br>\n\n\n\n  Sent: Wednesday, May 18, 2005<br><br>\n\n\n  Dear Brother:<br><br>\n\n  I am just delighted all is going well. This is great news. I will be \ngoing out of town again Thursday May 19th.  I am going down to Atlantic \nCity to try to straighten things out.  Luckily, I don't normaly hold \nservice on Sundays, we have two other preachers who alternate. I mostly \ntake the Message to the streets. I go into the bad neighborhoods and \ntalk sense to the prostitutes and drug addicts. I try to reach them on \ntheir own turf, because otherwise these people would never even come \ninside a church. Its rough. In Bridgport, they'll shoot you for walking \nfunny in some places.  I've been shot at, attacked, even robbed. But \nnever hurt. That ought to tell you something. All for preaching the \nWord.<br>\n  I've been missing service a lot lately, but I really gotta get back \ndown there.  I gotta win some money back.  Thats another reason I really \nneed this deal to come through. It will help me out a lot. Heck, MORE \nthan a lot!<br>\n  Glad all is well on your end.<br><br>\n\n  Enclosed are two pictures. One is of myself, and the other is of some \nfine people who belong to our congreation.<br><br>\n\n\n  Best,\n<br><br>\n<i>Oh this is rich.  Its starting to come together.  is on his way to \nAtlantic city to LOSE BIG, and our scammer is getting ready to make the \npitch for cash.  Gonna need some time on that one...<br>\nI sent the scammer a picture of a famous Black American gospel singer \nlooking VERY preacher like, standing in a church.  And a photo, grabbed \noff the net of some people sitting around drinking wine and smiling. \nSupposedly congreation members. LOL!!!  I'll have to get some casino \npictures next.  </i>\n<br><br>\n\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "2005-05-18 00:00", "subject": "God Will Bless For Your Help.", "author_role": "scam", "body": "Dear Rev.
