So\nwhat is the problem with you not been able to print the form? Endeavor\nto act fast because I know how they behave here and having it at the\nback of your mind that they are forcefully taking over our company and\nbusinesses, so please try your possible best to meet up with their\nbefore they start telling fun stories later. They might say you delay\nthat is the reason why they might not want to approve your payment. Do\neverything at your disposal to make sure that you always meet their\ndeadline and appointment. You should know what this project mean to you,\nand me I believe you know. <br><br>\n\nAnd in regards, to the bribe issue it is a normal thing here especially\nwhen you are in a situation whereby you want to get something vital from\nthem, they will make sure that they will want to frustrate you to a\npoint of breaking. Please I beg you in the name of your father anything\nthey demand of you please do it and I know at the end we will have God\nto that for his love and mercies. <br><br>\n\nAs you said you've been dealing with our custom officer, it is good that\nyou understand how things are been handled here. It is better to spend a\nlittle than to loose everything because they can be out to spoil\neverything just for there our gains. Please I await you constant\nbriefing. <br><br>\nFor we meeting now, is not ideal and convenient for me because I don't\nwant to loose any money from this project if I might consider the amount\nof money that this project has cost me to bring it to this final stage,\nas you know the bribe culture here in every office or department lot of\nmoney is spent before the vital documents and approvals can be granted.\nSo for now I am relatively grounded on cash and I don't want anything\nthat will jeopardize this project. <br><br>\n\nI will give you my word, which is my bond after this project I will be\nfor you as long as you want me to, I hope that will be ok by you, but\nfor now business first and once you have receive the money in your\nnominated bank account will now reisgn my appoitment and then join you\nfor good.

Really, the guy is clueless,\njust tries to come off like a heavyweight. \n<br><br>\nKim, I see no reason for you to stay in Russia any longer and I want you\nto come here now. I'm serious about this. What happens if this whole\nthing never materializes? There's still nothing you can do there, and\nyou'll still have to leave. There is absolutely no reason any longer for\nyou to stay there.\n<br><br>\nI want you to write back and let me know that you'll be here next week.\nI will arrange to take a few days off so we can spend time together. I\nhave to insist on this, the time is now! I won't take no for an answer\non this.
