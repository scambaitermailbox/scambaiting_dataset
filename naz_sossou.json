Are you not salaried? Do you work on a commission basis, perhaps a combination of the two forms of financial compensation?\n\nI guarantee you, sir, that we will all get what we deserve in this transaction, at the end of it.\n\nI contacted Kelly Anderson. Here is a copy of my mail, sent just this morning:\n\n\n\nI do hope we can conclude this business soon. My sons are making my life quite unpleasant, with their car buying requests.

'E'S DONE!!!\")\n\nAn interesting aside,  raynaz picked up her ringing phone a week or so ago, and a DECIDEDLY foreign-accented voice asked for \"Pearl\", actually, \"Pull\".\n\nDeciding to play along, raynaz asked the caller what this concerned, and was told that he represented an organization that helped fraud victims recover any money lost. He asked if Pearl had lost any money, and how much?\n\nPulling a number from thin air,\"$65,000\", raynaz explained that Pearl wasn't home now, but would be available the next morning.  This lad didn't explain how he got the number, which he recited as, \"**-**-***-***\", (in true Laddian fashion) but rang off, and called the next day.\n\n\"Pearl\" answered the phone, and played innocent, and told Lad that she banked at the \"Bank of Arizona\" and gave him a string of numbers culled from the calendar, so easily remembered.  Lad wanted $395 for this 'service' of his, and Pearl kept repeating \"Put the $65 thousand back into my checking account, then we'll talk about your $395.\"\n\nThis went back and forth for a few minutes, then \"Pearl\" told Lad that her son, a member of the Anti-fraud Unit of the police department...(not really) had warned her about scams, and she knew what he was up to.  She started laughing at him, and he called her, \"Dirty bitch!\" twice, and then things got really vulgar.  Lad had just worked himself up to the \"m-f-ing (something or another), and I hung up on him.\n\nHe called right back, but I let the answer-machine get it, and was treated to a very loud tirade of profanity that I hadn't heard since the old Navy days!  I turned down the volume, so I wouldn't have to hear it, and deleted the message.\n\nHe hasn't called back. ~whew~\n\nSo, stick another fork in him.  He's done here, too!\n\nBest, your fiend, raynaz", "But no! there's more. This is the final flip-off.

Hopefully, I beleive that this business relationship will lead us to a strong and deep friendship. Actually, I feel that God has blessed it, so it will be beneficial to us and our families for good and happy life. \n\nHowever, I am very happy about your quick response, Of course If this transaction does not require a foreigner especially from your country, I don't think I needed a second Party, I would have handled it all alone. Nevertheless, I know that you might be wondering why I have decided to trust you with this huge sum, but the truth is that I need you to pull out this money before our corrupt government will confiscate it or get forfeited to the bank as unclaimed fund. I know also that you will be amazed at the level of trust that I am willing to place in a person that I have never seen nor spoken with you.\n\nIn the percentage issue I have agreed that it should equal 50/50 but any thing more than that please forget it, why I agree on that is because you and I may have some little expenses in this transaction. So if you are ready for us to work as one partner to make sure this fund is transferred into your account, just send the infomations I requested from you and let us start immediately without more delay.

It was just a typo, an error! Later in the mail, I see where you've written 1000 pounds, so I know that's what you mean. But I still don't understand why you cannot deduct the E.U Transfer Statutory Deposit Charge from the $500.000 (now \u00a3&poud;44,350)just last week, the rate was \u00a3245,938, so you see, with all your delays, and dilly-dallying, my money is now worth fewer British pounds.\n\nIt would certainly expedite the matter, and make it more convenient, as well, if you will get in touch with Mr. Jack Hoff at the Strumpetshire bank, and arrange to wire-transfer into my account, which I have given you the particulars. Then you may deduct your fee to secure the Payment Security Confirmation Code (PSCC) at that time. I'm sure you will agree that this would be the quickest way to do this.\n\nI shall be home all week, and I certainly hope we can conclude this business before I lose too many more British pounds--this latest delay has cost me nearly \u00a31600.\n\nMr. Anderson, I hope to hear from you soon.\n\nThank you, Mrs. Pearl E.

It was just a typo, an error! Later in the mail, I see where you've written 1000 pounds, so I know that's what you mean. But I still don't understand why you cannot deduct the E.U Transfer Statutory Deposit Charge from the $500.000 (now &pound;&poud;44,350)just last week, the rate was &pound;245,938, so you see, with all your delays, and dilly-dallying, my money is now worth fewer British pounds.<br /><br />\n\nIt would certainly expedite the matter, and make it more convenient, as well, if you will get in touch with Mr. Jack Hoff at the Strumpetshire bank, and arrange to wire-transfer into my account, which I have given you the particulars.

I don't think such a bank exists, and this system would know if it does!\"<br /><br />\n\nThen, Jack proceeded to tell me about the 419-scams, and the con-men who try to swindle their victims out of many thousands of pounds! I couldn't believe it! I told him about John Sossou, and Abdoulaye Alfari, and Chukwu Farleigh, and James Goodluck, and you! He said, \"More than likely, \"they\" are all the same scammer, working from some dirty internet cafe in Lagos, Nigeria. They tell you to send some money, then they want more, and more, and more! They don't care if you give them all your money, if you have to borrow or steal more, they don't care! Whatever you do, don't send any money to anybody! But, if you want to have some fun with him, tell him you've got the money, and you will send it, and wait to see what he does when it never comes to him.\"<br /><br />\n\nI said that I couldn't be that cruel. We said our good-byes, and I came back home.<br /><br />\n\nSo, there you have it. I was saved by my dear old friend, Jack Hoff.
