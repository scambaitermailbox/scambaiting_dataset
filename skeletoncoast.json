I see a lot of these types of letters.  Honestly, that is OK with me.  I need the help of someone like you.  Maybe you and I can work together on a project that I guarantee will make you more money than 20 years of scam letters.\n\nI work as a maintenace person for a group that does geological surveys in Namibia. Being the maintenance person, I have the keys to every building and every room here.  A few weeks ago, I was working in one the buildings and found that money is stored there.  I did not take the time to count it, but I could clearly see that there was several hundred thousand dollars.\n\nI can easily get my hands on this money but I cannot leave with it.  It would be obvious who took it if I disappeared at the same time the money did.  What I need is a partner, someone who can physically pick up this money, get it far away from here, and hold onto to it for about a month or two until I can meet with them and divide it up.\n\nI have written to a couple other people like you about this.  All they do is ask me to send them money.  They act like common beggars.  I do not need a beggar.  I need a partner.\n\nYou interested?\n\nTroy\n\n\n\n", "raw": "From: Troy McClure\nTo: Steven Okoma\nDate: Jun 30, 2006 08:14 AM\nSubject: Your email\n\nHello,\n\nPlease do not take offense to this but I know that your letter is a scam.
