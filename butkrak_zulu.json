I think this may be the way forward.\n</p>\n \n<p>\nIf this does not suit you then there is always the proposed upgrade to the Sydney Opera House, also another contentious election issue. You may be familiar with the building, a large performing arts centre on the harbour that resembles white sails on a boat. The plan is to locate a theme park in the land around it, with the world's largest rollercoaster. The tracks of the rollercoaster will run up and down and across the sails. The contentious issue is that the darlings of the opera world will have their performances interrupted every 3-4 minutes by the screams of the theme park riders above. Investors are being called for soon.\n</p>\n \n<p>\nYou say you are \"not good in business\". I am sure you must be, to rise to the position of Deputy Minister of Public Works in your government. They would not give that job to just anyone. Plus you have the experience of all the committees and councils you work on. I am pleased to hear you have been to the embassy to get your visa processed. Are you planning to announce your resignation from parliament and departure from South Africa or are you just going to leave without telling anyone? What will the people of the Tshwane East Branch have to say about that. Very daring of you!\n</p>\n \nAs soon as I hear from Mr Smith that the transfer has gone though I will arrange to send you what you require for you know what.
