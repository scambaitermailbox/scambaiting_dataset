For the purpose of introduction, I am Mr. Ayo \nPatrick Mbagi, the son of Dr. Matelo Mbagi, a wealthy farmer/politician in\nZimbabwe who was recently murdered in the land dispute in my country.\nI got your contact through the internet based on our urgent need for a\ndependable and trustworthy foreign partner. Hence I decided to write\nto you.\nBefore the death of my late father, he had taken me to Johannesburg to\ndeposit the sum total of US$20.5 million (Twenty million, Five Hundred\nthousand United States dollars), in one of the private security companies, \nas he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. This money\nwas deposited in two boxes as Family Treasures to avoid much demurrage\nfrom the security company. This amount was meant for the purchase of\nnew machines and chemicals for the Farms and the establishment of new\nfarms in Swaziland.\nThe land problem, in our country came when our President Mr. Robert\nMugabe in a bid to win his re-election, introduced a new Land Act\nReform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and some few black\nfarmers who are members of the opposition party. This resulted in\nkillings and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics\nin the society. A lot of people have been killed because of this Land\nreform Act for which my father was unfortunately one of the victims.\nIt is against this background that, I and my family fled Harare our\ncapital for fear of our lives and are currently staying in a remote\ncountry side of Bulawayo. We are planning to leave the country and\nseek political asylum in Europe and we have decided to move our family\nwealth to Europe.\nAs the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility\nof seeking a genuine partner that could assist us without the\nknowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything we have\ngot, and the South African government seems to be playing along with\nthem. I am faced with the dilemma of moving this amount of money out\nof South Africa for fear of going through the same experience in\nfuture, since both countries have similar political history.\nI am now seeking for a partner whom I have to entrust my future and\nthat of my family in his/her hands. To this end, we need your\nassistance to stand as the Beneficiary of the Consignments in Europe.\nThis is because we are under restricted movement and watch and hence\nwe want to be very careful in order not to lose this fund which we\nhave worked so hard for. I have a sufficient CONTACT person at the\nSecurity Company in South Africa who can help us move this money to\nEurope under DIPLOMATIC COVER to another Security Company in Europe\nwith your details as the Beneficiary. This is 100% legal and will not\npass through normal Customs/Airport Screening.\nThus, if you are willing to assist us to move this fund out of South\nAfrica, you can contact me through my email addresses above,\nwith your telephone, fax number and personal information to enable us\ndiscuss further details. I must let you know that this transaction is\nrisk free as far as we keep it as confidential as possible.\nThank you, many blessings to you.\n\nYours Faithfully,\n\nMr. Ayo Patrick Mbagi. \n\nN/B :AS SOON AS I GET YOUR DETAILS I WILL GIVE YOU A CALL FOR FURTHER\nDISCUSSION AND YOU CAN ALSO REACH ME ON THE EMAIL ADDRESS BELOW\nbayopatricks@email.com", "raw": "<tr>\n<td width=15%></td>\n<td width=70%>   \n<font face=\"Arial,Verdana\">\n\n\n<b><font color=\"brown\">MR AYO PATRICK MBAGI</font></b><br><br>\n\nFrom: \"Mr Ayo Patrick Mbagi\"  cert@email.com <br>\nReply-To: ayo2patrick@yahoo.co.uk<br>\nTo: Kindly Contributor<br>\nDate: Sat, 27 Sep 2003 15:17:22 +0100<br>\nSubject: Very Important<br><br>\n\nDear Sir,<br><br>\n\nYou may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not\nknow me personally.
