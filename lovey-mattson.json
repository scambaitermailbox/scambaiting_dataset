I was married to the millionaire Thurston Howell, but after being rescued from years on a desert island (after what was supposed to be  a three-hour tour), we broke up. Thurston had been having an affair with Mary Anne the whole time, and back in the USA he went nuts what with all the other women around. I wound up with pretty much nothing from the divorce, and had to learn to make a living. So I became a physical therapist for other wheelchair users (I'll spare you the details of my accident, let's just say that the Skipper was not a well man and pianos on hydraulic lifts are not as much fun as you'd think).\nRecently, I decided to move. \nCraigslist listed a really nice place for a price so low it had to be bogus.\n\nI searched Craigslist for the terms used in the ad, and found the real ad, with the real rent (way higher). The scammer copied it. This is a well-known scam in Nigeria, where its Nigerian victims sometimes put signs on their houses saying \"This house is not for sale\". But the scammers don't even have to be on the same continent as the homeowner or the prospective tenant.\n\n\nFor fun, I responded to the scammer. I hope this little correspondence keeps other people from being scammed.\n--Kisses, Lovey", "RENT QUESTIONNAIRE\n 1)Your Full Name?\n 2)Your Full Address & Phone Number?\n 3)Are you married?\n 4)How many people will be living in the house?\n 5)Do you have a pet?\n 6)Do you have a car?\n 7)Occupation?\n 8)how long lease are you looking for?\n 9)How soon do you intend moving in?\n 10)Reason for relocating?\n\n\nI hereby apply to lease the above described premises for the term and upon the set conditions above set forth and agree that the rental is to be payable the first day of each month in advance.
