THAT DAY I SUMMONED COURAGE TO INVITE PABLO THE \n BANDIT  FOR A LUNCH,ON A ROUND TABLE MEETING, WHILE WE \n ARE ENJOYING OURSELVES WITH SOME DELICIOUS FOOD AND \n DRINKS,I FOCUSED HIS MEMORY ON OUR DISCUSSION TO THE \n IMPORTANCE OF FISHING AND PROFIT THEREIN.I WAS ABLE TO \n CONVINCE HIM AND HAVE A SCHEDULE TO ACCOMPANY ME IN A \n FISHING OUTING,THAT DAY,IT WAS MIRACULOUS AS  HE COULD \n NOT BELIEVE THE NUMBER OF FISHES WE CAUGHT WHICH \n ATTRACTED A LOT OF PROFITS,we continued this exercise \n for a period of three days before I encourage him to \n begin on his own. \n\nAfter Pablo was assumed to be converted  when he was \n initially introduced into Bass fishing and he played \n the sport for the first day on his own, every one \n thought that Pablo will automatically not succumb to \n his previous criminal life but surprisingly we found \n out that he even proceeded to commit more dangerous \n acting.  This time Pablo involved in car snatching,   \n he joined a gang that operate  in the major roads \n blocking people with their own cars, snatching cars \n under gun point. In a specific attack by Pablo and his \n gang just after a week he left us and started on his \n own,he went an operation where they snatch two cars, \n they did not only snatched two cars but rather they \n had stop-over and robbed a very big filling station \n ,collected all the available cash and drove off. But \n being intelligent gang, they did not continue with \n these cars to avoid easy tracing, they therefore, \n swiftly double- crossed another  Peugeot car and made \n away with it abandoning the former vehicles they were \n with. The attack was a very dangerous one but did not \n claim any life. \n\n The following day, the news quickly spread all over \n the town and after my thorough investigation, I found \n out that Mr Pablo was among the team that took the \n operation. It started to beat my imagination why pablo \n will behaved abnormally again after our previous \n fishing outings which efforts were made to convince \n him to a normal business activity. I visualised and \n gazed that probably he was not satisfied with the bass \n fishing \nAND SPECIFICALLY THE USAGE OF \"SLINKAMATIC \n GET-M-KRAZEE BASS-BLASTER HYDROCARBON WORM\". PABLO \n LAMENTED THAT WHAT CONTRIBUTED IMMENSELY TO \n DEMORALIZED HIM TO THE GRASS ROOT AND WHY HE TOOK THE \n DECISION TO DISENGAGE HIMSELF FROM FISHING ACTIVITIES \n AND JOINED BACK TO HIS FORMER UGLY BUSINESS OF HOUSE \n BREAKING (BREAK AN ENTRY) AND EVEN TO  THE EXTENT OF \n JOINING THE GANG OF CAR SNATCHERS WAS WHEN HE APPLIED \n THE USE OF  \"SLINKAMATIC GET-M-KRAZEE BASS-BLASTER \n HYDROCARBON WORM\". THIS SYSTEM OF FISHING HE \n CRITISIZED IS BORING,INEFFICIENCY,FATIGUE, AND NEEDS \n AN ADDITIONAL ENERGY AND STAMINA TO OPERATE.WORST \n STILL, HE COMMENTED THAT THE ODOUR IS VERY IRRITATING, \n UNPLEASANT AND CHOCKING. HE FURTHER SAID THAT THIS \n INSTRUMENT NEEDS TO BE MODERNIZE IN ORDER TO SUIT THE \n YOUNG AND FUTURE GENERATION OR BE PHASED OUT ENTIRELY \n FROM THE SOCIETY TO AVOID DISCOURAGING THE YOUTHS WHO \n HAVE BRIGHTER HOPE IN ADOPTING FISHING AS AN \n OCCUPATION.ALL THESE NEGATIVE QUALITIES THIS MACHINE \n POSSESS  RESULTED TO THE EXTENT THAT THE FISH ITSELF \n SEES THE UGLINESS AND THEREFORE THE WORMS BECOME \n UNATTRACTIVE,UNNATURAL APPEARANCE AND FEELS ARTIFICIAL \n THEREFORE GENERATE FORCES THAT REPEL FISHES. IN THIS \n CASE, IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO CATCH FISH AND ONES \n PURPOSE IS THEN DEFEATED.IN A NUTSHEL, WE WANT TO USE \n THIS MEDIUM TO CAUTION  THE ENTIRE PUBLIC AND TO \n CREATE AWARENESS CONCERNING THE ABOVE MACHINE WHICH \n CAUSES  HARM THAN GOOD WHEN IT IS APPLIED IN USE. \n\nI immediately thought it wise to introduce him using \n wiggle baby plastic worm; It took me an additional \n effort and sweet tongue to convinced him just to have \n a schedule with me for another private talk. After \n Pablo has considered his last operation \n and the huge money realised, he felt satisfactory and \n thought he was on the top of the world. But \n notwithstanding, I succeeded afterward \n summoning a meeting with him convincing him to \n accompany me once again to fishing outing .This time \n around I introduced him to WIGGLE BABY PLASTIC WORM \n which yielded a perfect result. This time,Pablo saw \n the difference and believed that all FINGERS ARE \n NOT EQUAL  after comparison with  the former method \n of fishing and the performances of the WIGGLE BABY \n PLASTIC WORM. He lamented \"I saw with an infinite \n pleasure, the great object of my mission\". \n He was attracted with every quality of this product \n more especially the pleasant odour possessed by the \n worm just like the fragrance oozing out from a \n hibiscus flowers which stimulates somebody to feel \n like the world is a bird of roses. . Pablo was felt \n with full attraction of the WORM which possessed a \n natural appearance like a living  earth WORM, \n sighting his feeling  on the  magnificent  WORM \n on his hand and the way it was turning itself round \n like if it was a  real living  object ,Pablo was \n actually convinced that through this STRAWBERRY \n STINKER WORM sporting,  he could make a good living \n without being told. He even wanted to go home with the \n worm just to be making sure he always stays around it \n just for the comfort and joy he derives. He further \n lamented that one will be opportune to caught a lot of \n\n fishes when once this STRAWBERRY STINKER WORM enters \n into the sea swimming majestically  creating \n attraction to the fish.   In this case  and to save \n the life of this young man and others, we lend some \n spares of our STRAWBERRY STINKER WORM to Pablo   \n and he is still making use of this  magnificent \n instrument sporting  with his  group turning up  huge \n quantities of fishes in all their outings, given \n testimony about WIGGLE BABY PLASTIC WORM and to God \n for his life saved. \n\n It may interest you to know that Mr Pablo has \n presently turned to be a recognised great fishing \n sportsman with his group as they always make a large \n turn over compared with others in the field as such \n they are  one of the leading suppliers of fishes to \n our continental hotels and government guest houses \n including prisons and other large consumers even to \n our nearby countries like Guinea Conakry, Ghana and \n Burkina Faso. \nMeanwhile, their immediate project is establishing a \n fishing pond which is taking place in YAMOUSSOUKRO \n the administrative capital city  of Cote d\u0092 Ivoire. \n Recently, Pablo recognising the source of his wealth \n and where he started approached us for order of more \n WIGGLE BABY PLASTIC WORM in a large quantity. You can \n bear with us and see by yourself how STRAWBERRY \n STINKER WORM  had changed a notorious armed robber to \n a recognised and genuine person in the society. We \n therefore plead for your maximum co-operation in \n making sure this productis supplied to us without \n delay to enable us satisfy the demand. \n   TO SEE WHAT PLASTIC WORM FISHING HAS DONE BY \n CHANGING AUTOMATICALLY THE ENTIRE LIFE OF THIS HARD \n CRIMINAL.HE REALISED THAT USING THIS MACHING IS \n SIMPLE,YIELDS PROFITS AND DOSE NOT SUBJECT HIM TO MORE \n DANGER COMPARED TO HIS FORMER OCCUPATION.I AM NOT \n TRYING TO EXAGERATE, THIS  YOUNG MAN HAS UNTILL TODAY \n CONVERTED REASONABLE NUMBERS OF HIS CRIMINAL \n COLLEAGUES TO A BETTER LIFE BY INTRODUCING THEM TO \n JOIN THE BASS FISHING. \n VERY IMPORTANT,WE WILL LIKE TO KNOW HOW MUCH IT WOULD \n COST US TO IMPORT THE MACHINES TO MAKE THE WORMS.THE \n NAME OF THE MACHINE IS A WORMIATOR PLASTIC BAIT \n EXTRUDER. \n SIR,IN ORDER TO REDUCE CRIME TO THE GRASS ROOT LEVEL \n IN THIS COUNTRY AND TO SALVAGE THE UGLY SITUATION,WE \n ARE OF THE OPINION THAT YOU SUPPLY US YOUR WORMIATOR \n MACHINE IN A VERY LARGE QUANTITY AND ALSO VISIT OUR \n COUNTRY TO INCULCATE YOUR PROFESSIONAL IDEAS AND \n TECHNICAL- KNOW- HOW TO US FOR MORE IMPROVEMENT.WHEN \n ONCE THIS IS DONE,IT WILL GIVE MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO \n ABSORB NEW EMPLOYEES WHO ARE SEEKING FOR EMPLOYMENT \n AND THEREFORE REDUCING CRIMES IN OUR COUNTRY COTE \n D'IVOIRE. \n\n YOURS SINCERLY, \n\n MARIAM AND IDRIS MUSTAPHA."], "messages": [{"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "", "author_role": "scam", "body": "TO YOUR MERCY\nDear Sir,\nMy name is  Mrs Mariam Z.

{"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "", "author_role": "bait", "body": "Dear Mariam:\nThank you for your quick reply! I can see that you are\nserious about this business, and so am I, I assure\nyou. I will be able to nominate the business account\nof my plastic worm company (\"BLUE CRESCENT EAT-M-UP\nWIGGLE-BABIES INC.\") to receive the funds. As you may\nknow, bass-fishing is one of the fastest-growing\nsports in America. Some 465,000 tons (930 million\npounds) of largemouth, and 248,000 tons of smallmouth\nbass are caught every year in my country by sportsmen.\nA large quantity of these fish are caught via the\nplastic worm, which has long been known to be the most\nsuccessful method for catching these wily creatures of\nlake and stream.\nSo it will not be a problem to claim a large order of\nplastic worms to be sent to your country.\nIn fact, it might be useful for you to write some\nemails to me at this address, which is famous\nthroughout the bass-fishing world, inviting me to\nadvise you how the bass fishing business might be\ndeveloped in your country.\nLet me give you some background, so our operation may\nproceed 100% hitch-free. The Largemouth Bass\n(Micropterus Salmonides) is the most popular\nfresh-water sportfish in the world. It is a voracious\nfeeder, and prefers to hide (lurk) behind growth or\nobjects (\"structure\") in the water and then pounce and\ninhale smaller fish or other prey with its extremely\n\"large\" mouth. That is why it is known as the\n\"largemouth\" bass, because of the size of its mouth,\nwhich is quite \"large\", and therefore the fish is\nnamed after the size of its mouth, this being so\n\"large\" that it was deemed suitable to name the fish\nthe \"largemouth\" bass, due to the size of the opening\nof this organ, its mouth, which, being extremely\n\"large\" is the most distinctive feature of this\nanimal, and has therefore influenced the very naming\nand identification of the fish, the \"largemouth\" bass,\nso called due to the size of its mouth, which is\nexcessively \"large\" in comparison with the same organ\nof other species of fishes. \nThis fish is responsible for billions of dollars in\nprofit every year, and has made me a comfortable man,\nif my modesty may escape me. The plastic worm has\nproven to be absolutely irresistible to these\ncreatures. To dangle one of our purple\n\"GRAPE-A-LISHUS\" models before a largemouth bass is as\nif to dangle a strong liquor before an alcoholic, or a\nchocolate tart before an obese and gluttonous woman.\nThis is the key to my company's success, and let it be\nthe key to ours as well.\nWhat I need from you is this. You will write me an\nemail explaining that you are an entrepreneur who is a\nlifelong sportsman, and you are interested in becoming\nan import agent for the well known BLUE CRESCENT\nEAT-M-UP WIGGLE BABIES plastic worm. You will ask me\nthe best way to market them, and ask other advice\nmeant to ensure the success of your enterprise. This\nwill provide a solid background for our own private\nbusiness, and will set my mind to rest, so that I will\nbe able to proceed with all haste with the\ntransaction.\nCan you recommend some good hotels in the area where I\ncan stay when the time comes? How much money will I\nneed to bring with me? I can withdraw any amount from\n\"Eat-M-UP\"... that is the advantage to being the sole\nowner!  \nUpon completion of the transaction, I will be happy to\nhook you up with some real estate agents who will show\nyou some fine homes. May I suggest the city of  Gary,\nIndiana?

I can see that you are\nserious about this business, and so am I, I assure\nyou. I will be able to nominate the business account\nof my plastic worm company (\"BLUE CRESCENT EAT-M-UP\nWIGGLE-BABIES INC.\") to receive the funds. As you may\nknow, bass-fishing is one of the fastest-growing\nsports in America. Some 465,000 tons (930 million\npounds) of largemouth, and 248,000 tons of smallmouth\nbass are caught every year in my country by sportsmen.\nA large quantity of these fish are caught via the\nplastic worm, which has long been known to be the most\nsuccessful method for catching these wily creatures of\nlake and stream.</P>\n\n<P>So it will not be a problem to claim a large order of\nplastic worms to be sent to your country.\nIn fact, it might be useful for you to write some\nemails to me at this address, which is famous\nthroughout the bass-fishing world, inviting me to\nadvise you how the bass fishing business might be\ndeveloped in your country.</P>\n\n<P>Let me give you some background, so our operation may\nproceed 100% hitch-free. The Largemouth Bass\n(Micropterus Salmonides) is the most popular\nfresh-water sportfish in the world. It is a voracious\nfeeder, and prefers to hide (lurk) behind growth or\nobjects (\"structure\") in the water and then pounce and\ninhale smaller fish or other prey with its extremely\n\"large\" mouth. That is why it is known as the\n\"largemouth\" bass, because of the size of its mouth,\nwhich is quite \"large\", and therefore the fish is\nnamed after the size of its mouth, this being so\n\"large\" that it was deemed suitable to name the fish\nthe \"largemouth\" bass, due to the size of the opening\nof this organ, its mouth, which, being extremely\n\"large\" is the most distinctive feature of this\nanimal, and has therefore influenced the very naming\nand identification of the fish, the \"largemouth\" bass,\nso called due to the size of its mouth, which is\nexcessively \"large\" in comparison with the same organ\nof other species of fishes. </P>\n\n<P>This fish is responsible for billions of dollars in\nprofit every year, and has made me a comfortable man,\nif my modesty may escape me. The plastic worm has\nproven to be absolutely irresistible to these\ncreatures. To dangle one of our purple\n\"GRAPE-A-LISHUS\" models before a largemouth bass is as\nif to dangle a strong liquor before an alcoholic, or a\nchocolate tart before an obese and gluttonous woman.\nThis is the key to my company's success, and let it be\nthe key to ours as well.</P>\n\n<P>What I need from you is this. You will write me an\nemail explaining that you are an entrepreneur who is a\nlifelong sportsman, and you are interested in becoming\nan import agent for the well known BLUE CRESCENT\nEAT-M-UP WIGGLE BABIES plastic worm. You will ask me\nthe best way to market them, and ask other advice\nmeant to ensure the success of your enterprise. This\nwill provide a solid background for our own private\nbusiness, and will set my mind to rest, so that I will\nbe able to proceed with all haste with the\ntransaction.</P>\n\n<P>Can you recommend some good hotels in the area where I\ncan stay when the time comes? How much money will I\nneed to bring with me? I can withdraw any amount from\n\"Eat-M-UP\"... that is the advantage to being the sole\nowner!  </P>\n\n<P>Upon completion of the transaction, I will be happy to\nhook you up with some real estate agents who will show\nyou some fine homes. May I suggest the city of  Gary,\nIndiana? It is home to the finest people in our\ncountry, and is the garden-spot of the United States.\nThere was even a song written about it, called \"Gary\nIndiana\". Maybe you know it?

I am working on closing a\ncontract for the distribution of my fishing lures in\nMauritania, as we continue to make headway in our\nefforts at worldwide distribution of the EAT-M-UP\nWIGGLE BABY product line.\nTo continue...you must compose a letter to me,\n\"Liberace\" (no \"Mr\" please) in which you will relate\nto me an experience you had while fishing with my\n\"Strawberry Stinker\" model plastic worm. You know your\nlocal geography far better than I, so choose a body of\nwater, and describe an outing you had during which you\nused this product and found it to be far more\nsuccessful than any other similar product you have\nused in the past. THE MORE DETAIL THE BETTER!  PLEASE\nUSE YOUR IMAGINATION!\nFor example: \"The weather was perfect for fishing, the\nsky was overcast and a low pressure system was moving\nin from the north. ..\" This sort of thing. You will\nthen describe how you saw a large bass (fish) in the\nwater and sent the plastic worm to that spot. As soon\nas the worm hit the water, the fish pounced upon it\nwith all fury. You battled with the fish for some\ntime. The fish was so strong you thought he would pull\nyour arms off. The battle raged for at least 2 hours,\nuntil you brought into the boat a 95 pound largemouth\nbass.\nWhen you removed the worm from his mouth the great\nfish lunged for it yet again, in the bottom of the\nboat, so desperate was he to consume the \"Strawberry\nStinker\".\nThen you will say that surely such a magnificent\nplastic worm can be the source of great profits to\nyou, were you to sell this product in your country. In\nfact, this product, you feel, would open up all sorts\nof opportunities to develop the sport of bass fishing,\nand therefore you are greatly interested in investing\nin the \"EAT-M-UP WIGGLE BABY\" line. You will also add\n(VERY IMPORTANT!) that you feel that if the youth of\nyour country were to spend more time bass fishing than\ncausing trouble and behaving in criminal fashion, the\ncountry would be better off morally and socially. This\nwill add credibility to your great desire to\ndistribute the product. You will also ask me how much\nit would cost to import the machines to make the\nworms. \nThe name of the machine is a WORMIATOR PLASTIC BAIT\nEXTRUDER. Please ask for the machine BY NAME, as it\nwill show that you are serious enough to have done\nsome research into the matter.\nThe longer and more detailed your fishing story is,\nthe better the result will be, as it will show your\nextreme enthusiasm for the product, and will help to\nexplain why you are willing to devote such a large sum\ntowards its manufacture and sale. It is important that\nyou try to take the information I have just told you\nand FIT IT TO YOUR OWN WORDS.

I am working on closing a\ncontract for the distribution of my fishing lures in\nMauritania, as we continue to make headway in our\nefforts at worldwide distribution of the EAT-M-UP\nWIGGLE BABY product line.</P>\n\n<P>To continue...you must compose a letter to me,\n\"Liberace\" (no \"Mr\" please) in which you will relate\nto me an experience you had while fishing with my\n\"Strawberry Stinker\" model plastic worm. You know your\nlocal geography far better than I, so choose a body of\nwater, and describe an outing you had during which you\nused this product and found it to be far more\nsuccessful than any other similar product you have\nused in the past. THE MORE DETAIL THE BETTER!  PLEASE\nUSE YOUR IMAGINATION!</P>\n\n<P>For example: \"The weather was perfect for fishing, the\nsky was overcast and a low pressure system was moving\nin from the north. ..\" This sort of thing. You will\nthen describe how you saw a large bass (fish) in the\nwater and sent the plastic worm to that spot. As soon\nas the worm hit the water, the fish pounced upon it\nwith all fury. You battled with the fish for some\ntime. The fish was so strong you thought he would pull\nyour arms off. The battle raged for at least 2 hours,\nuntil you brought into the boat a 95 pound largemouth\nbass.\nWhen you removed the worm from his mouth the great\nfish lunged for it yet again, in the bottom of the\nboat, so desperate was he to consume the \"Strawberry\nStinker\".</P>\n\n<P>Then you will say that surely such a magnificent\nplastic worm can be the source of great profits to\nyou, were you to sell this product in your country. In\nfact, this product, you feel, would open up all sorts\nof opportunities to develop the sport of bass fishing,\nand therefore you are greatly interested in investing\nin the \"EAT-M-UP WIGGLE BABY\" line. You will also add\n(VERY IMPORTANT!) that you feel that if the youth of\nyour country were to spend more time bass fishing than\ncausing trouble and behaving in criminal fashion, the\ncountry would be better off morally and socially. This\nwill add credibility to your great desire to\ndistribute the product. You will also ask me how much\nit would cost to import the machines to make the\nworms. </P>\n\n<P>The name of the machine is a WORMIATOR PLASTIC BAIT\nEXTRUDER. Please ask for the machine BY NAME, as it\nwill show that you are serious enough to have done\nsome research into the matter.</P>\n\n<P>The longer and more detailed your fishing story is,\nthe better the result will be, as it will show your\nextreme enthusiasm for the product, and will help to\nexplain why you are willing to devote such a large sum\ntowards its manufacture and sale. It is important that\nyou try to take the information I have just told you\nand FIT IT TO YOUR OWN WORDS.

All you needed was a little encouragement.\nPlease accept my sincere apologies for this tardy\nresponse. Business is booming for Blue Crescent\nEat-M-Up Wiggle Babies. We are very proud of our\naccomplishments. I have been extremely busy closing\nthe deal on our Mauritania contract. You will be\npleased to know that we now represent almost 100% of\nthe bass fishing outlets in all of Mauritania! We are\nnow in the final stages of organizing the Central\nAlgerian Bassmaster Fishing Tournament. Our North\nAfrican/Sahara branch is growing by leaps and bounds.\nOur own transaction will join quite naturally with the\nbig push into the African continent. \nThe fishing content of the letter is absolutely\nwonderful, just what we need. Your letter will be\ncompletely acceptable with the addition of just one\nmore detail. My company directs a local Youth\nFacility, and we have a well known outreach program\ngeared towards developing the moral standards of\nmisguided young adults in the area.\nIt would be a big help to the credibility and\nacceptance of the transaction if you could write in\nmore detail about the troubles your country is\nexperiencing with the criminality of its youth. \nPlease understand that I know what is best, as I know\nmy country and I know my company. If the Board of\nDirectors sees that you have a serious problem with\nyour youth, they will be more than willing to\nunderwrite all activities and transactions which are\nin\nany way related to alleviating this situation. BELIEVE\nME, I KNOW WHAT I AM DOING!  If they see that you are\nserious about this situation, they will give me a\nBLANK CHECK, and 100% SUPPORT for any and all dealings\nwe have with one another. ONCE THIS IS IN PLACE, WE\nMAY PROCEED WITH ALL HASTE.\nAs with the previous item, this must be as\npersonalized as possible. I would like you to relate\nthe story of one particular youth whose life was\nredeemed through fishing. THIS WILL BRING TEARS TO\nTHEIR EYES!  Please go into detail regarding his\ncriminal behaviour. Just make up a story about his\ncriminal activity, detailing clearly his specific\ncrimes. Then relate how you invited him out on a\nfishing trip, and tell how his life was changed\nforever. THIS MUST BE ABOUT 3 PARAGRAPHS, AND BE AS\nDETAILED AS POSSIBLE.\nPlease stick with it.

Please let your\nbass-fishing friends, including Pablo, know about\nthis. It will be worth the trip, I assure you! It is\nto be held during the same week as a local downhill\nski racing tournament, and therefore the crowd is sure\nto be large, and in a festive mood.

However, we must bear in mind that the main\nidea is to show how the PLASTIC WORM ITSELF provided\nthe inspiration for Pablo to better himself. If you\ncould only add a few important details, I will\nimmediately present the letter to the Board of\nDirectors. Then it will be a simple matter to obtain\nwhat we call a \"TABULA RASA\". This document is a\nwithdrawal form which contains the signatures of our\nTreasurer and our Chief Financial Officer, with\neverything filled out except the amount of money to be\nwithdrawn. The form may be re-used as often as\nnecessary.\nAs for the very important details: it is of the utmost\nimportance that you make VERY CLEAR that it is not\nonly bass fishing which has turned Pablo onto the\nstraight path, but specifically the WIGGLE BABY\nPLASTIC WORM. May I suggest that you explain how Pablo\nhad attempted to fish using another plastic worm, but\nwas so disappointed with the results that he went out\nand committed a serious crime LATER THAT SAME DAY! It\nis very important that you be SPECIFIC regarding the\nparticular crime which he committed. This adds to the\ncredibility of the account. Explain how the Wiggle\nBaby Plastic Worm, its lifelike appearance, its\nnatural touch and pleasant odour all combined to\nencourage Pablo. PLEASE BE VERY SPECIFIC. GO ON AT\nSOME LENGTH DESCRIBING THE QUALITIES OF THE WIGGLE\nBABY PLASTIC WORM.\nI am certain that once this is accomplished, I will be\nable to present your letter to the Board of Directors,\nand come away with a TABULA RASA. Please do this with\nall speed, as I would like very much to begin the\nactual transaction. I would not like to spend much\nmore time on the composing of this very important\nletter. Please do your best to see that it is\nperfectly executed.\nBy the way, you mentioned in your letter about Pablo\nthat your territory is Koumassi. Is not Koumassi\nlocated in the country of Ghana? Are you in Ghana? Or\nare you in Cote D'Ivoire, as you first mentioned?\nPerhaps I misunderstood something?\n\nBest, and God Bless you and your family,\n\nLiberace\n\nSez Fannerman: \nSez us: Let's not hold him to that!", "raw": "<HR>\n\n<b>\n<p><font  color=\"purple\">THE FINAL ASSIGNMENT?</font></p>\n</b>                 \n\n\n<P>Sez Fannerman: <I>\n...Well, I\ndon't think \"Mariam and Idris\" will be getting out the\nblue pencil again...not after the last letter I sent,\nwhich follows:\n</I></P>\n\n\nDear Mariam,<br><br>\n\n<P>I hope this finds you and your family in good health\nand spirits.

All flights using this\ntravel modality must be approved by MYSELF, so you may\nbe assured of maximum welcome. Just let me know as\nsoon as possible, ok?</P>\n\n<P>You might be pleased to know that owing to the success\nof last year's event, we are sponsoring another Bass\nFishing Tournament at the popular resort town of\nAraouane, in West-Central Mali. Please let your\nbass-fishing friends, including Pablo, know about\nthis. It will be worth the trip, I assure you! It is\nto be held during the same week as a local downhill\nski racing tournament, and therefore the crowd is sure\nto be large, and in a festive mood. Africa is\ncertainly turning out to be a gold mine for Wiggle\nBaby...all the more reason to maintain high confidence\nin the success of our transaction!</P>\n\n<P>What can I say? Your letter has touched my heart. It\nmakes even myself want to give what I can to assist\nthe troubled youth of your country in their endeavors\ntoward becoming useful and productive citizens. The\nbackground was thorough and convincing.</P>\n\n<P>I can see that you understand very well what I have\nbeen suggesting. Your latest letter is ALMOST 100%\nPERFECT! However, we must bear in mind that the main\nidea is to show how the PLASTIC WORM ITSELF provided\nthe inspiration for Pablo to better himself. If you\ncould only add a few important details, I will\nimmediately present the letter to the Board of\nDirectors. Then it will be a simple matter to obtain\nwhat we call a \"TABULA RASA\". This document is a\nwithdrawal form which contains the signatures of our\nTreasurer and our Chief Financial Officer, with\neverything filled out except the amount of money to be\nwithdrawn. The form may be re-used as often as\nnecessary.</P>\n\n<P>As for the very important details: it is of the utmost\nimportance that you make VERY CLEAR that it is not\nonly bass fishing which has turned Pablo onto the\nstraight path, but specifically the WIGGLE BABY\nPLASTIC WORM. May I suggest that you explain how Pablo\nhad attempted to fish using another plastic worm, but\nwas so disappointed with the results that he went out\nand committed a serious crime LATER THAT SAME DAY! It\nis very important that you be SPECIFIC regarding the\nparticular crime which he committed. This adds to the\ncredibility of the account. Explain how the Wiggle\nBaby Plastic Worm, its lifelike appearance, its\nnatural touch and pleasant odour all combined to\nencourage Pablo. PLEASE BE VERY SPECIFIC. GO ON AT\nSOME LENGTH DESCRIBING THE QUALITIES OF THE WIGGLE\nBABY PLASTIC WORM.</P>\n\n<P>I am certain that once this is accomplished, I will be\nable to present your letter to the Board of Directors,\nand come away with a TABULA RASA. Please do this with\nall speed, as I would like very much to begin the\nactual transaction. I would not like to spend much\nmore time on the composing of this very important\nletter. Please do your best to see that it is\nperfectly executed.</P>\n\n<P>By the way, you mentioned in your letter about Pablo\nthat your territory is Koumassi. Is not Koumassi\nlocated in the country of Ghana? Are you in Ghana? Or\nare you in Cote D'Ivoire, as you first mentioned?\nPerhaps I misunderstood something?</P>\n\nBest, and God Bless you and your family,<br><br>\n\nLiberace\n\n<p>Sez Fannerman: <i>\nThat's all to date.

THAT DAY I SUMMONED COURAGE TO INVITE PABLO THE \n BANDIT  FOR A LUNCH,ON A ROUND TABLE MEETING, WHILE WE \n ARE ENJOYING OURSELVES WITH SOME DELICIOUS FOOD AND \n DRINKS,I FOCUSED HIS MEMORY ON OUR DISCUSSION TO THE \n IMPORTANCE OF FISHING AND PROFIT THEREIN.I WAS ABLE TO \n CONVINCE HIM AND HAVE A SCHEDULE TO ACCOMPANY ME IN A \n FISHING OUTING,THAT DAY,IT WAS MIRACULOUS AS  HE COULD \n NOT BELIEVE THE NUMBER OF FISHES WE CAUGHT WHICH \n ATTRACTED A LOT OF PROFITS,we continued this exercise \n for a period of three days before I encourage him to \n begin on his own. \n\nAfter Pablo was assumed to be converted  when he was \n initially introduced into Bass fishing and he played \n the sport for the first day on his own, every one \n thought that Pablo will automatically not succumb to \n his previous criminal life but surprisingly we found \n out that he even proceeded to commit more dangerous \n acting.  This time Pablo involved in car snatching,   \n he joined a gang that operate  in the major roads \n blocking people with their own cars, snatching cars \n under gun point. In a specific attack by Pablo and his \n gang just after a week he left us and started on his \n own,he went an operation where they snatch two cars, \n they did not only snatched two cars but rather they \n had stop-over and robbed a very big filling station \n ,collected all the available cash and drove off. But \n being intelligent gang, they did not continue with \n these cars to avoid easy tracing, they therefore, \n swiftly double- crossed another  Peugeot car and made \n away with it abandoning the former vehicles they were \n with. The attack was a very dangerous one but did not \n claim any life. \n\n The following day, the news quickly spread all over \n the town and after my thorough investigation, I found \n out that Mr Pablo was among the team that took the \n operation. It started to beat my imagination why Pablo \n will behaved abnormally again after our Previous \n fishing outings which efforts were made to convince \n him to a normal business activity. I visualised and \n gazed that probably he was not satisfied with the Bass \n fishing, I immediately thought it wise to introduce \n him using WIGGLE BABY PLASTIC WORM; It took me an \n additional effort and sweet tongue to convinced him \n just to have a schedule with me for another private \n talk. After Pablo has considered his last operation \n and the huge money realised, he felt satisfactory and \n thought he was on the top of the world. But \n notwithstanding, I succeeded afterward \n summoning a meeting with him convincing him to \n accompany me once again to fishing outing .This time \n around I introduced him to WIGGLE BABY PLASTIC WORM \n which yielded a perfect result. This time,Pablo saw \n the difference and believed that all FINGERS ARE \n NOT EQUAL  after comparison with  the former method \n of fishing and the performances of the WIGGLE BABY \n PLASTIC WORM. He lamented \"I saw with an infinite \n pleasure, the great object of my mission\". \n He was attracted with every quality of this product \n more especially the pleasant odour possessed by the \n worm just like the fragrance oozing out from a \n hibiscus flowers which stimulates somebody to feel \n like the world is a bird of roses. . Pablo was felt \n with full attraction of the WORM which possessed a \n natural appearance like a living  earth WORM, \n sighting his feeling  on the  magnificent  WORM \n on his hand and the way it was turning itself round \n like if it was a  real living  object ,Pablo was \n actually convinced that through this STRAWBERRY \n STINKER WORM sporting,  he could make a good living \n without being told. He even wanted to go home with the \n worm just to be making sure he always stays around it \n just for the comfort and joy he derives. He further \n lamented that one will be opportune to caught a lot of \n fishes when once this STRAWBERRY STINKER WORM enters \n into the sea swimming majestically  creating \n attraction to the fish.   In this case  and to save \n the life of this young man and others, we lend some \n spares of our STRAWBERRY STINKER WORM to Pablo   \n and he is still making use of this  magnificent \n instrument sporting  with his  group turning up  huge \n quantities of fishes in all their outings, given \n testimony about WIGGLE BABY PLASTIC WORM and to God \n for his life saved. \n\nIt may interest you to know that Mr Pablo has \n presently turned to be a recognised great fishing \n sportsman with his group as they always make a large \n turn over compared with others in the field as such \n they are  one of the leading suppliers of fishes to \n our continental hotels and government guest houses \n including prisons and other large consumers even to \n our nearby countries like Guinea Conakry, Ghana and \n Burkina Faso. \nMeanwhile, their immediate project is establishing a \n fishing pond which is taking place in YAMOUSSOUKRO \n the administrative capital city  of Cote d\u0092 Ivoire. \n Recently, Pablo recognising the source of his wealth \n and where he started approached us for order of more \n WIGGLE BABY PLASTIC WORM in a large quantity. You can \n bear with us and see by yourself how STRAWBERRY \n STINKER WORM  had changed a notorious armed robber to \n a recognised and genuine person in the society.

THAT DAY I SUMMONED COURAGE TO INVITE PABLO THE \n BANDIT  FOR A LUNCH,ON A ROUND TABLE MEETING, WHILE WE \n ARE ENJOYING OURSELVES WITH SOME DELICIOUS FOOD AND \n DRINKS,I FOCUSED HIS MEMORY ON OUR DISCUSSION TO THE \n IMPORTANCE OF FISHING AND PROFIT THEREIN.I WAS ABLE TO \n CONVINCE HIM AND HAVE A SCHEDULE TO ACCOMPANY ME IN A \n FISHING OUTING,THAT DAY,IT WAS MIRACULOUS AS  HE COULD \n NOT BELIEVE THE NUMBER OF FISHES WE CAUGHT WHICH \n ATTRACTED A LOT OF PROFITS,we continued this exercise \n for a period of three days before I encourage him to \n begin on his own. \n</P>   \n <P>After Pablo was assumed to be converted  when he was \n initially introduced into Bass fishing and he played \n the sport for the first day on his own, every one \n thought that Pablo will automatically not succumb to \n his previous criminal life but surprisingly we found \n out that he even proceeded to commit more dangerous \n acting.  This time Pablo involved in car snatching,   \n he joined a gang that operate  in the major roads \n blocking people with their own cars, snatching cars \n under gun point. In a specific attack by Pablo and his \n gang just after a week he left us and started on his \n own,he went an operation where they snatch two cars, \n they did not only snatched two cars but rather they \n had stop-over and robbed a very big filling station \n ,collected all the available cash and drove off. But \n being intelligent gang, they did not continue with \n these cars to avoid easy tracing, they therefore, \n swiftly double- crossed another  Peugeot car and made \n away with it abandoning the former vehicles they were \n with. The attack was a very dangerous one but did not \n claim any life. \n</P>   \n<P> The following day, the news quickly spread all over \n the town and after my thorough investigation, I found \n out that Mr Pablo was among the team that took the \n operation. It started to beat my imagination why Pablo \n will behaved abnormally again after our Previous \n fishing outings which efforts were made to convince \n him to a normal business activity. I visualised and \n gazed that probably he was not satisfied with the Bass \n fishing, I immediately thought it wise to introduce \n him using WIGGLE BABY PLASTIC WORM; It took me an \n additional effort and sweet tongue to convinced him \n just to have a schedule with me for another private \n talk. After Pablo has considered his last operation \n and the huge money realised, he felt satisfactory and \n thought he was on the top of the world. But \n notwithstanding, I succeeded afterward \n summoning a meeting with him convincing him to \n accompany me once again to fishing outing .This time \n around I introduced him to WIGGLE BABY PLASTIC WORM \n which yielded a perfect result. This time,Pablo saw \n the difference and believed that all FINGERS ARE \n NOT EQUAL  after comparison with  the former method \n of fishing and the performances of the WIGGLE BABY \n PLASTIC WORM. He lamented \"I saw with an infinite \n pleasure, the great object of my mission\". \n He was attracted with every quality of this product \n more especially the pleasant odour possessed by the \n worm just like the fragrance oozing out from a \n hibiscus flowers which stimulates somebody to feel \n like the world is a bird of roses. . Pablo was felt \n with full attraction of the WORM which possessed a \n natural appearance like a living  earth WORM, \n sighting his feeling  on the  magnificent  WORM \n on his hand and the way it was turning itself round \n like if it was a  real living  object ,Pablo was \n actually convinced that through this STRAWBERRY \n STINKER WORM sporting,  he could make a good living \n without being told. He even wanted to go home with the \n worm just to be making sure he always stays around it \n just for the comfort and joy he derives. He further \n lamented that one will be opportune to caught a lot of \n fishes when once this STRAWBERRY STINKER WORM enters \n into the sea swimming majestically  creating \n attraction to the fish.   In this case  and to save \n the life of this young man and others, we lend some \n spares of our STRAWBERRY STINKER WORM to Pablo   \n and he is still making use of this  magnificent \n instrument sporting  with his  group turning up  huge \n quantities of fishes in all their outings, given \n testimony about WIGGLE BABY PLASTIC WORM and to God \n for his life saved. \n</P>\n <P>It may interest you to know that Mr Pablo has \n presently turned to be a recognised great fishing \n sportsman with his group as they always make a large \n turn over compared with others in the field as such \n they are  one of the leading suppliers of fishes to \n our continental hotels and government guest houses \n including prisons and other large consumers even to \n our nearby countries like Guinea Conakry, Ghana and \n Burkina Faso. </P>\n    \n <P>Meanwhile, their immediate project is establishing a \n fishing pond which is taking place in YAMOUSSOUKRO \n the administrative capital city  of Cote d\u0092 Ivoire. \n Recently, Pablo recognising the source of his wealth \n and where he started approached us for order of more \n WIGGLE BABY PLASTIC WORM in a large quantity. You can \n bear with us and see by yourself how STRAWBERRY \n STINKER WORM  had changed a notorious armed robber to \n a recognised and genuine person in the society. We \n therefore plead for your maximum co-operation in \n making sure this productis supplied to us without \n delay to enable us satisfy the demand. \n</P>   \n   <P>TO SEE WHAT PLASTIC WORM FISHING HAS DONE BY \n CHANGING AUTOMATICALLY THE ENTIRE LIFE OF THIS HARD \n CRIMINAL.HE REALISED THAT USING THIS MACHING IS \n SIMPLE,YIELDS PROFITS AND DOSE NOT SUBJECT HIM TO MORE \n DANGER COMPARED TO HIS FORMER OCCUPATION.I AM NOT \n TRYING TO EXAGERATE, THIS  YOUNG MAN HAS UNTILL TODAY \n CONVERTED REASONABLE NUMBERS OF HIS CRIMINAL \n COLLEAGUES TO A BETTER LIFE BY INTRODUCING THEM TO \n JOIN THE BASS FISHING. \n</P>\n <P>VERY IMPORTANT,WE WILL LIKE TO KNOW HOW MUCH IT WOULD \n COST US TO IMPORT THE MACHINES TO MAKE THE WORMS.THE \n NAME OF THE MACHINE IS A WORMIATOR PLASTIC BAIT \n EXTRUDER. \n</P>\n <P>SIR,IN ORDER TO REDUCE CRIME TO THE GRASS ROOT LEVEL \n IN THIS COUNTRY AND TO SALVAGE THE UGLY SITUATION,WE \n ARE OF THE OPINION THAT YOU SUPPLY US YOUR WORMIATOR \n MACHINE IN A VERY LARGE QUANTITY AND ALSO VISIT OUR \n COUNTRY TO INCULCATE YOUR PROFESSIONAL IDEAS AND \n TECHNICAL- KNOW- HOW TO US FOR MORE IMPROVEMENT.WHEN \n ONCE THIS IS DONE,IT WILL GIVE MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO \n ABSORB NEW EMPLOYEES WHO ARE SEEKING FOR EMPLOYMENT \n AND THEREFORE REDUCING CRIMES IN OUR COUNTRY COTE \n D'IVOIRE. \n</P>\n YOURS SINCERLY, <br><br>\n\n MARIAM AND IDRIS MUSTAPHA. \n\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "", "author_role": "bait", "body": "Sez Fannerman: \n\n Dear Mariam and Idris, \n I hope this finds you both well, especially Mariam, \n who, God willing, is recuperating speedily from her \n recent illness, and for whom I have been praying \n daily.
