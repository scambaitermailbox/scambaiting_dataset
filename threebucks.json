Is your phone working? We tried MANY TIMES to call\nyou, but the line or circuit is BUSY all the time!\nMaybe the phone line between our two countries is NOT\nSO GOOD? \n\n\n\n4.  I have worked very hard all last night to help\nyou, along with my KIND AND SEXY WIFE who is also very\nSMART. We provide the useful information to you below\nregarding your FLIGHT, your HOUSE, and the MONEY to be\nsent to you!! My wife, she also feels SO SAD that you\nlanguish in an AWFUL REFUGEE CAMP, dominated by the\nblue helmeted UNHCR GOONS, and that you're whole\nfamily has been SHOT and KILLED! Sometimes, I wonder,\nwhat a TERRIBLE WORLD!  Maybe one day you can return\nto Sierra Leone and RE-OPEN the DIAMOND business, and\nget your life on TRACK. Maybe even rebel leader Famoy\nSankoh will be RELEASED and can return to power,\nassuming he is not DEPORTED to the Hague for a WAR\nCRIMES TRIAL!! I saw \"Cry Freetown\" on CNN and it made\nme CRY! My wife kindly asks for a family PHOTO of you,\nmaybe with your wife or girlfriend, that we can FRAME\nand put over our fireplace to ADMIRE!! This way, we\ncan THINK OF YOU while we wait for your arrival!\n\n\n\n5.  Travel plans: We have worked out your travel plans\nwith our TRAVEL AGENT. She is very good and found a\nvery AFFORDABLE business class seat for you on the\nreliable British Airways. Only $2,650!!!  I have\nreserved an UPPER DECK WINDOW SEAT in your name and I\ncan pay the travel agent next Monday. It will be\nissued in the British Air ticket office in \"Kotoka\nInternational Airport\". I think this in Accra, GHANA.\nCan you get there OK by yourself?\n\n\n6.  British Air is good, and much SAFER than most, but\nI cannot vouch for the food or INFLIGHT SERVICE. Do\nyou belong to their MILEAGE PROGRAM?  If so, send me\nyour FREQUENT FLYER NUMBER, and I can be sure you get\nall the MILES once you fly!! Will any other family\nmembers be travelling? If so, advise and I can also\nmake bookings for THEM. Here is the itinerary:\n\n\n\nFlight:  British Airways flight 78 on a Boeing 767 Jet\n- non-stop  \n\nDepart:  Accra, Ghana (ACC) - Thu, Feb 21 at 11:50pm \n\nArrive:  London Heathrow, UK (LHR) - Fri, Feb 22 at\n6:55am \n\nMeals:  Meal Served \n\n\n    \nFlight:  British Airways flight 31 on a Boeing 747 Jet\n- 1 stop \n \nDepart:  London Heathrow, UK (LHR) - Fri, Feb 22 at\n5:00pm \n\nArrive:  Manila, Philippines (MNL) - Sat, Feb 23 at\n4:05pm \n\nMeals:  Meal Served \n\n\n\n7.  Visa: We spoke with HIGH-LEVEL FRIENDS at the\nOffice of Foreign Affairs, and they can issue a \"note\nverbal\" for you to use in Ghana for getting your\nPhilippine VISA. They require your passport details,\nincluding passport number, date of birth, and a photo\nof your face. Please send this RIGHT AWAY and they\nwill issue the VISA LETTER to the Philippine consulate\nin Accra. IMAGINE, in just 6 short weeks, you will be\nhere on the beach in BORACAY, maybe even WINDSURFING!\nThis will be a nice change for you! Do you have any\nFRIENDS here in Asia? Maybe we can INVITE THEM TOO!!!\n\n\n\n8.. House: This is a complicated issue, as you will\nneed to look around and CHOOSE one that is RIGHT for\nyou. I asked my realtor to provide once nice example,\nwhich I am showing to you below. We must ensure that\nthe house you pick is LARGE ENOUGH and has the RIGHT\nFEATURES you need.\n\n\n\nResidential House and Lot, Lot Area:  262 sq. meters,\nFloor Area:  138 sq. meters. \nA fully furnished bungalow, ready to move in!  Newly\nconstructed, built in 1999.  Located in one of the\nfast growing suburbs of Metro Manila, within a totally\nenclosed private subdivision of ninety houses.  A\nquiet area with no through-traffic. \n\n\nIs this the type of house you like, or do you need\nsomething more PALATIAL? With your money, you can\npretty much buy ANY HOUSE HERE YOU WANT!!\n\n\n\n9.  Wire money: I went to my bank today to arrange to\nWIRE the $5,000 to you IMMEDIATELY, and they suggested\na BETTER IDEA!!! I wish I had thought of it. They\nsuggest we use WESTERN UNION, which is easy and\nbetter!!! It will work like this: I bring CASH to the\nWestern Union agent here in Manila, at my bank, and we\nfill out a form and send it to YOU, straight away, via\nWestern Union. All you have to do is go to Western\nUnion with the SECRET PASSWORD CODE NUMBER and collect\nthe MONEY. It is TOO EASY! \n\n\n\n10.  There are two locations, but I do not know which\none is better. One is the Agricultural Development\nBank, Nungua Branch, near Nungua New Kindly Contributor (not the\nold one!), in Accra, Ghana, tel: (233) (021)236884.\nThe other branch is at ECOBANK, 19 Seventh Avenue,\nRidge West, Accra, tel: (233) (21) 232094. Please PICK\nONE and advise so I can SEND THE MONEY QUICKLY,\nhopefully before the weekend when I do not have email\nanymore until Monday. Once you tell me the best\nlocation, I can send the CASH and email you the SECRET\nPASSWORD CODE NUMBER, which you must PROMISE NOT TO\nLOSE OR SHOW TO ANYONE!!!\n\n\n\n11.   Now to get to the BUSINESS END of this email,\nwhich I am ashamed to go into right now because you\nare SUFFERING and we are now GOOD FRIENDS FOR LIFE.\nBut about my $50,000 BUSINESS ADVISORY FEE, is this in\nADDITION to, or PART of my $1.5 million share of the\n$15 million? If so, then I am DUE $1,5050,000, NOT\nJUST $1.5 MILLION!!! It is a small point, but as you\nknow, business and friendship often DOESN'T MIX, so we\nneed to GET THIS RIGHT EARLY ON!! \n\n\n\n12.  Also, will you bring the rest of the CASH to\nManila, or wire it in advance? I am concerned because\nAfrica is a DANGEROUS PLACE, and if you walk around\nwith $15 million, maybe someone will HIT YOU ON THE\nHEAD and take it. That would be such a VIOLENT\nTRAGEDY! We need to THINK, and BE CAREFUL, and PRAY TO\nGOD that all goes well! Maybe you can hire a SECURITY\nBODYGUARD to FOLLOW YOU AROUND, which rich people do\nhere all the time?\n\n\n\n13.  We are SO CLOSE I can taste the $1.5 million! \nBut let me be HUMBLE, it just that even though I work\nso hard very day in a bank, I DREAM of having WADS OF\nCASH to throw around mindlessly, buying things like a\nRANGE ROVER 4.6 and skiing in ZERMATT.

I have added this to the amount of $5,000\nBRIBE MONEY for the security company for a TOTAL OF\n$19,250. This I HOPE will give you and your loved ones\nSAFE PASSAGE!

He strongly advised me to consider a SAFE\nPLACE for you to retrieve the money and we studied a\nMAP. We have selected BURKINA FASO which is very close\nnext door to you, only maybe 550 km, and you must\ncross the border at Navrongo maybe by LONG-DISTANCE\nTAXI. The Western Union office is at ECOBANK, 2025 Rue\nAlwata Diawara 01, BP 2094, BOBO DIOULASSO, BURKINA\nFASO. You must go to this place and QUICKLY get the\nmoney WITHOUT DELAY!!!\n\n\n\n3.  Bobo Dioulasso is the largest town inhabited by\nthe BOBO PEOPLE of Burkina Faso, with attractive\nstreets, a lively cafe street scene, and a bustling\n \"GRANDE MARCHE\".\n\n\n\n4.

Let us also talk about INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES\nfor your remaining $13.5 million. We MUST get this\nmoney \"to WORK FOR YOU\"! I would like to present to\nyou FOUR MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR IDEAS $$$ for your kind\nconsideration. I will provide a full BUSINESS PLAN for\nany you choose after your careful review. Each GREAT\nIDEA only requires maybe $3 million START-UP FUNDS!\n\n\n\n-  HOLLYWOOD BLOCKBUSTER MOVIE FILM: This is BIG MONEY\nbecause everyone loves a good MOVIE! I have a\ntreatment that can be developed into a FULL SCREENPLAY\nfor immediate field production. It is about the SANKOH\nFAMILY STORY of your plight, the WAR, the torture, the\ndeath of your sister, your escape, and saving the\nFAMILY TREASURE!!! We need to have a \"SUPERFLY\" hero\nlike you, who escapes and maybe gets to Harlem,\nAmerica for 15 minutes of FAME as a big-time PIMP with\nyour \"RIDE\" and your \"HO BITCHES\".

Big casinos like\nCEASAR'S PALACE make BILLIONS of dollars $$$ from\nSUCKER gamblers. We must get a PIECE OF THE ACTION!\nMany casinos have a THEME, like \"Ceasar's Rome\" or\n\"Venice Italy\" or \"New York\" or \"Circus Circus\". My\nhuge idea is a SLUM THEME to let rich high-stakes\nGAMBLERS get a THIRD-WORLD ADVENTURE while gambling.\nThey can play Baccarat in a \"FAVELA\" or 7-card Stud\nPoker in a \"SQUATTER BARRIO\", with STREET URCHINS\nACTORS serving food and drinks!!! It will be an\nAMAZING experience for the gamblers, and help develop\nSOCIAL CONSCIENCE!!

For a small start-up,\nwe can build a PROPER SHOPPE here with books,\nmagazines, PRIVATE video viewing booths, and sell\nparaphernalia like huge electric DILDOS and special\nBEN-WAH BALLS. We can even showcase videos of SEXY\nMOMMA BABE-A-RAMAS getting BUTT-SLAMMED by FARM\nANIMALS!!! This is a BIG BIG MONEY-MAKER!!!\n\n\n\n-  7-11 FRANCHISE: When you and your poor family\narrive, we need to provide JOB OPPORTUNITIES!!!

You\nmust use this right answer to collect the money.  \n\nQuestion: \"WHE SENT THE MONEY?\"<BR>\n\nAnswer: \"WISE GUY\"\n<BR>\n\n6.  Let us also talk about INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES\nfor your remaining $13.5 million. We MUST get this\nmoney \"to WORK FOR YOU\"! I would like to present to\nyou FOUR MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR IDEAS $$$ for your kind\nconsideration. I will provide a full BUSINESS PLAN for\nany you choose after your careful review. Each GREAT\nIDEA only requires maybe $3 million START-UP FUNDS!<BR>\n<BR>\n\n\n-  HOLLYWOOD BLOCKBUSTER MOVIE FILM: This is BIG MONEY\nbecause everyone loves a good MOVIE! I have a\ntreatment that can be developed into a FULL SCREENPLAY\nfor immediate field production. It is about the SANKOH\nFAMILY STORY of your plight, the WAR, the torture, the\ndeath of your sister, your escape, and saving the\nFAMILY TREASURE!!! We need to have a \"SUPERFLY\" hero\nlike you, who escapes and maybe gets to Harlem,\nAmerica for 15 minutes of FAME as a big-time PIMP with\nyour \"RIDE\" and your \"HO BITCHES\". Maybe this is a\ncomedy for laughs? Think \"THE GODS MUST BE CRAZY\"\nmeets \"DEBBIE DOES DALLAS\"!!!<BR>\n<BR>\n\n\n-  THIRD-WORLD SLUM CASINO: Maybe you know LAS VEGAS,\nentertainment capital of the world? Big casinos like\nCEASAR'S PALACE make BILLIONS of dollars $$$ from\nSUCKER gamblers. We must get a PIECE OF THE ACTION!\nMany casinos have a THEME, like \"Ceasar's Rome\" or\n\"Venice Italy\" or \"New York\" or \"Circus Circus\". My\nhuge idea is a SLUM THEME to let rich high-stakes\nGAMBLERS get a THIRD-WORLD ADVENTURE while gambling.\nThey can play Baccarat in a \"FAVELA\" or 7-card Stud\nPoker in a \"SQUATTER BARRIO\", with STREET URCHINS\nACTORS serving food and drinks!!! It will be an\nAMAZING experience for the gamblers, and help develop\nSOCIAL CONSCIENCE!! What do you think?!!<BR>\n<BR>\n\n\n-  XXX ADULT BOOKSTORE AND VIDEO SHOPPE: Do not be\nashamed of this, it is a $300 billion year industry\nand everyone \"SPANKS THE MONKEY! For a small start-up,\nwe can build a PROPER SHOPPE here with books,\nmagazines, PRIVATE video viewing booths, and sell\nparaphernalia like huge electric DILDOS and special\nBEN-WAH BALLS. We can even showcase videos of SEXY\nMOMMA BABE-A-RAMAS getting BUTT-SLAMMED by FARM\nANIMALS!!! This is a BIG BIG MONEY-MAKER!!!<BR>\n<BR>\n\n\n-  7-11 FRANCHISE: When you and your poor family\narrive, we need to provide JOB OPPORTUNITIES!!! A 7-11\nfranchise offers for sale convenience foods, like\nmicrowave BURRITOS and SLURPEES, real big sellers!\nThis can TURN YOUR MONEY INTO GOLD! <BR>\n<BR>\n\nTony Escober, I am so happy this is coming together! I\nsee LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL for you. Soon,\nafter going to Western Union in BF, please email me\nRIGHT AWAY to confirm your good fortune! DO NOT TAKE\nCHANCES WITH STRANGERS!!!<BR>\n<BR>\n\n\nLet us also take time to THANKS BE TO GOD for our\nchance meeting, and that we can HELP EACH OTHER FOR A\nBETTER LIFE!
