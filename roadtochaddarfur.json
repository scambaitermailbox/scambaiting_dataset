I was starting to think that you were retarded or something.  Is it too late to ask for a postcard from Khartoum?  Haha, just kidding.  Save your money for the trip back.  How is Khartoum by the way?  I've never been there and I am really curious.\n\nSecond, you asked me why I did all this.  I'll tell you why.  It's mostly because I hate people that try to scam honest, hard working people out of their life savings.  I hate, even more, people that are willing to steal from priests and from homeless refugees.  That's right fool; I knew you were a scammer from your very first letter you sent last year.  Can you believe it?  That was 8 months ago.  Wow.  How time flies by.\n\nI've got to say this though, you were quite the challenge.  I get fools like you to travel all the time but it usually takes less than a month.  There were times that I almost gave up on you.\n\nHow do you suppose Oney is doing?  He is one of the monkies that you sent to Farchana, isn't he?  Do you think that he is still alive or perhaps he is getting regularly ass-fucked by the barbarian horde in some prison in Darfur?  It's a shame that you did not go with him and the other guy.  I could have gotten three scammers at one time.\n\nBy the way, did you know that you are famous now?  That's right Achiu, famous.  For the last month or so, I have been sharing every email, every detail with thousands of other people like me that also enjoy messing with stupid little boys like you.

Maybe when the boys eventually crawl out from whatever rock they are under, your family will let you go back to Lagos.\n\nWell, cocktard, I've said just about all that I wanted to.  When you get to Antarctica, be sure to stay bundled up.  It gets pretty damn cold there you know.  And if you find yourself a bit light on cash, give me call.  I'll see if I can Western Union some money to you.\n\nBlessings\n\nRev.

I was starting to think that you were retarded or something.  Is it too late to ask for a postcard from Khartoum?  Haha, just kidding.  Save your money for the trip back.  How is Khartoum by the way?  I've never been there and I am really curious.\n\nSecond, you asked me why I did all this.  I'll tell you why.  It's mostly because I hate people that try to scam honest, hard working people out of their life savings.  I hate, even more, people that are willing to steal from priests and from homeless refugees.  That's right fool; I knew you were a scammer from your very first letter you sent last year.  Can you believe it?  That was 8 months ago.  Wow.  How time flies by.\n\nI've got to say this though, you were quite the challenge.  I get fools like you to travel all the time but it usually takes less than a month.  There were times that I almost gave up on you.\n\nHow do you suppose Oney is doing?  He is one of the monkies that you sent to Farchana, isn't he?  Do you think that he is still alive or perhaps he is getting regularly ass-fucked by the barbarian horde in some prison in Darfur?  It's a shame that you did not go with him and the other guy.  I could have gotten three scammers at one time.\n\nBy the way, did you know that you are famous now?  That's right Achiu, famous.
