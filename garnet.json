It is\nrather expensive\n                             for me to keep phoning so can you get him\nto try to\n                             phone me again? Remember I did not include\nthe\n                             international dialing code, you or he might\nhave to\n                             get that from your local phone company.\n\n                             Or do you want my lawyer to contact him\ndirectly? it\n                             might be easier that way. My lawyer was an\narmy\n                             lawyer, and in the 70's he was in Nigeria\nfor a while\n                             (perhaps the good Barrister Williams Sanni\nknows him)\n                             his name is Brigadier, The Right Hon. Lord\nArchibald\n                             Smythe QC. KFC. VC. NYC and Bar. Order of\nthe Knights\n                             of the Yellow Rose of Tex and Us. He is a\nrather\n                             imposing character, as well as being the\nChurch leader\n                             of My Seventh Day Adventist Parish. So he\ncan be\n                             trusted.<br><br>\n\n                             You didn't answer my question on the total\namount of\n                             money you want to move, it is a lot. (As\nyou know, I\n                             live in England, so can you tell me what\nthe money is\n                             worth in British Pounds?) The reason I ask\nthis rather\n                             gauche question is explained later on in\nthis letter.<br><br>\n\n                             As I mentioned in a previous e-mail letter\ndo you want\n                             me to see if I can use my connections in\nthe Church to\n                             help get you out of your terrible\nsituation. Maybe it\n                             would be easier for them to get all your\nmoney out at\n                             the same time as they help you and your\nchildren\n                             escape (So you wouldn't have to transfer\nit). You said\n                             it was in safekeeping in two trunks. How\nbig are these\n                             trunks? Would they fit in the back of a car\nor a van\n                             or a lorry?<br><br>\n\n                             This is all so exciting, did you see the\nSound Of\n                             Music? Julie Andrews escaped from the\nGermans by\n                             walking over the Alps. Perhaps Hollywood\nwould make a\n                             film about you, wouldn't that be romantic.<br><br>\n\n                             By the way, as a Christian I wouldn't dream\nof taking\n                             any money from you, my biggest reward would\nbe if you\n                             could become a member of our Faith and give\na little\n                             donation to The Seventh Day Adventist\nChurch to help\n                             in our overseas Missions and Aid Programs.<br><br>\n\n                             As we are getting so close could you send\nme a\n                             Photograph of you and your 10 children, and\nif you\n                             want me to I'll send one back of myself.<br><br>\n\n                             Yours in Christ the Saviour.
