However, he's still a viable target.\n\n\nDr. Eminko Banabas\n\n\n08 December 2006\nDear Mr,Malcolm Reynolds.\nI am writing you in related to your western union control number which was withheld by a \"STOP ORDER\" by Security forces due to acclaimed irregularities of origin of the money being transferred to you by your client/friend in the Union Togolaise de Banque branch of western union, of which I am the Controller /Manager. \nI have offered to help you, if only you agree to my terms.\nFirstly, I will not and never tolerate a third person hearing of this, it should be strictly between me and you, because I will not be led into losing my job and pride just trying to help you.\nSince the Court order, obtained by the Security force men, stopping the sending of the money, I will assist you by helping you get two of the MTCN numbers, which we can do thus: \nOn assisting you, for every 10,000 dollars as was sent to you, I get1,000 dollars from it, (i.e. for the 150,000 dollars, which is the number of \"SEND MONEY FORMS\" your partner sent, I will get the clerk to retrieve, I get 15,000 dollars). If you agree, then we can continue, if not do not even bother to reply.\nI have arranged with the court clerk, where the \"STOP-ORDER\" suit was filed, so we have to appeal as has always been the case, then on sitting (since it will be an expedited sitting-the next day), then the court clerk who has the send money forms presented to the court as exhibits, will \nhelp us in taking ALL OF IT from the \"EVIDENCE ROOM\", where it is being kept by the security men as \"EVIDENCE\" against your partner and the \"WESTERN UNION MANAGEMENT\" and replacing it with a \" SUPPOSED FAKE\" one (reduplication),so as I collect it from the court clerk, through the evidence room window, I will send them to you, for you to collect the money over there in your country and send me my share, and the forms to you and immediately the funds is released to you in your place. \nAll we have to do now is to file for an appeal, which will cost  about 250 dollars, so we can collect the MTCN Send Money Forms used in sending the money to you. You will have to send the money for the Appeal case-(250 dollars)-DON'YT ASK ME TO PAY, BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE IT.I AM ONLY HELPING YOU.SO END IT TO THIS NAME PEACE DOGBEY AND CALL ME +233275128085\nSend me your phone number, so immediately I get the MTCN numbers, I call you and give it to you, my office phone is connected to the INTERCOM, of MINISTRY of Finance, so I only call you, if I receive call with it the intercom operator will known that  I am helping you with this claim.\nFor your information, do not ever send the money by western union or money gram to Togo, as it will be traced to me by Security forces, better off, you can send to Ghana; aflao-lome border branch of western union, so I can send someone across the border to receive it, not to be traced by the \nSecurity forces.\nThank you.\nDr Eminko banabas Controller/Manager\nWestern Union Money Transfer, Union Togolaise De Banque (UTB), Lome-Togo\n\n\nI can use this..."], "messages": [{"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "", "author_role": "scam", "body": "Bring on our first contestant! \nMy first thought on seeing this was that I'd been drawn into someone else's bait... and that we have a Lad who never heard of the concept of a full stop.\n\n\n\n\n\n30 November 2006\nDear Sir\nMy name is Emmanuel Justice  who just called you right away I am From Freetown Republic of Sierra-Leone, I just came into Ghana to claim my Late Father consignments with my mother which he deposited in OBEST SECURITY COMPANY here in Accra Ghana, I and my mother have Claim the two consignments trunk boxes from the security company, They are now with us in the Bishop house who gives us support during the claim of the funds from the security company.
