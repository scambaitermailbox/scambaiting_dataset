It will appear on the Certification of Charitable Dispensation as issued, should the application be successful.\nWe have tried to avoid using jargon or technical terms in this application form, however there are some words or phrases which have specific meanings, and these are set out below:\nGoverning document - this is the document or documents which set out the objects or purposes ofthe dispensation and how it is to be spent and administered. It will usually be a declaration of trust, or memorandum of association with this office.\nObjects - these are the purposes of the charitable dispersement, whether to alleviate distress, or pay for the necessities of third world indigent life style & etc. The Objects set out what the dispersement is intended to achieve (they do not say what they will spent on a daily basis). Objects must be exclusivelycharitable if the allocation is to be recognised as a charitable.\n\nActivities - this is what the charitable recipient will do on a day-to-day basis to achieve the objects.\nActivities must be capable of furthering the objects of the charitable dispensation under consideration. If they are not, then either the organisation or individual is not a charitable item or the objects are wrongly drafted.\nExecuted - this means that the document in question has been signed and dated; it may also need to be sealed. In addition:\n a deed may need to be stamped by your legal representative or tribal elder(see note below);\nWe can only recognise a charitable cause and offer dispensation which has a properly executed governing document.\nCertified - To certify a document, a person authorised by the trustees to do so, should write on the document \"I certify that this is a true copy of \" and sign and date it.\nNotes for completing the Registration Application Form (APP 1)\nPlease read the following notes before completing this form.\nWhy is it necessary to provide all the information requested on the form?\n The Royal Household has to apply UK charity law in making decisions to ensure that organisations or individuals applying for extraordinary charitable dispensation meet the legal requirements for such relief, indigent or not.\nThe more information you are able to supply us with at the outset, the better our understanding will be. This makes our decision making easier and will mean that we are able to consider your application more quickly.\n If the form is not completed as appropriate or any of the information marked  on the checklist is missing, we will return the entire application to you for completion and resubmission.\nWe will not consider incomplete applications.\nHow does the registration process work?\n The Royal Charitable Office, under Lonslo Tossov DFC, has the general function of promoting effective use of charitable resources. We can do this by encouraging better methods of administration, by giving information and advice and by investigating and checking abuses. We have these functions whether or not a charitable organisation has been registered.\n We believe it is in the interests of charitable requests their supporters and their beneficiaries that they should start life as well equipped as possible to tackle their objectives - and it is far better for potential problem areas to be addressed at the beginning rather than wait until difficulties surface.\n\n As a result, throughout the registration process (including any correspondence which results from\nconsidering your application), we will address not only the issue of whether you or your organisation is charitable but also any governance issues which arise and on which we think it is appropriate to offer guidance. On some occasions issues may arise where it is not clear whether they relate to charitable status or to governance or both. We will always try to make it clear in our correspondence whether we are raising questions about charitable status or governance, or both.\n\n Where we give guidance, we will make it clear whether a particular course must be followed, or whether we are recommending it as good practice. We cannot insist that our recommendations are followed, but we would be concerned if you or your tribe ignored them without good reason.\n\n As registration is the first stage in what will be an ongoing relationship between yourself, your dependents, village elders etc and the Commission this is a particularly suitable occasion for us to gather some basic information about you which will help set off this relationship on an open and constructive basis.\nWhen does this form need to be completed?\nIt needs to be completed only when you have a clear idea of if you really require the funds for express charitable work.  Please do NOT apply until you have all the information you need to complete the form or you feel it will be spent on drink and women. This will help us to provide as quick a service as possible. If the application form is not fully completed and/or the documents marked * on the checklist are not enclosed, the application will be returned to you. We will only consider applications which are properly completed and accompanied by the required documentation.\n\nIf you need help completing this form or have any questions about the process of registration please\ntelephone Lonslo Tossov or his office where fully trained staff will be pleased to help. You may\nfind it helpful to read CC21 'Starting and Registering a Charitable claim for Indigent Natives' before completing this form.\nWho needs to complete the form?\nIt can be completed either by:\n -a charity recipient or proposed charity trustee, who is or will be one of the persons responsible for\nrunning the charity; or\n-a mendicant due to receive charitable relief pursuant to the claim\nHow long will the process take?\nYou should hear from us within 15 working days of submitting your application. Our response may be one of the following:\n1. A requests for further information if we do not consider we have enough information to make anassessment of charitable status\n2. An indication that in principle we are prepared to register your claim as a cerifiable native indigent, letting you know the steps involved to finalise the process.\n3. Questions and/or advice on your governance arrangements (including risk) if we think you might function more effectively by making some improvements - these questions may not have any\ndirect bearing on whether your claim is accepted but may be raised where we consider that by\ndealing with these issues at the beginning of your life as a charity you may avoid problems in the future.\nIn any subsequent correspondence we will seek to differentiate issues which relate primarily to\ncharitable status from issues which relate to personal governance, homosexuality or characteristic inebriation etc, although on some occasions questions may have relevance to both.\n\n4. An indication that rather more detailed consideration will be needed before we can give you a detailed response, for example, we may wish to take advice internally from lawyers or others before coming back to you in detail.\nInevitably the more unusual, novel or complex the case the longer it will take. But we recognise how\nimportant it is that small charities (those whose annual income is likely to be under \u20ac10,000) should receive a flexible and speedy response - and we may decide to defer asking questions about governance issues until a little later on in the life of the charity.\nTimescales for registration:\nWe aim to decide an application for registration in an average of 14 working days. However, we expect tobe able to complete this more quickly if the following apply:\n -your income is less than \u20ac10,000 per year;\n -you have used either:\n--a Commission or CLA model governing document without amendment and inserting specific\ncharitable objects; or\n --a standard governing document without amendment and with the agreement of the issuing body;\n\nand\n --you have answered fully and satisfactorily all of the questions on this form relevant to your\norganisation.\nWe will consider applications in respect of executed governing documents in whatever form. But the\nprocess will be completed much quicker if you have adopted either a standard or model governing\ndocument which has been previously agreed with us. More information can be found below and in CC22\n\nChoosing and Preparing a Governing Document.\nApplications in Welsh\nWe are happy to accept applications made in Welsh and which include a governing document in Welsh.\n\nHowever, we ask that if you are sending a governing document in Welsh you also include a certified\ntranslation into English. If you are unable to do this, we will arrange for a translation to be made. Whilst we do not wish to risk disagreement about the meaning or translation that might affect charitable status, we cannot accept any responsibility for mis-translation of a legally technical document. Please contact your lawyer or responsible tribal elder.\n\nAcceptance for registration as a charity means that the governing document of the organisation concerned will form part of the Register of Charities. The Register must be made available in a form which is understandable by the majority of the population of England and Wales to comply with the Charity Commission's statutory obligations. Whilst we require an English version of the document for these purposes the Welsh document also forms part of our registered particulars and is available for scrutiny by individuals visiting our offices and requesting to see it. Photocopies will also be available on request. The computerised Register will display the objects of the charity in both Welsh and English.\n\nPart 1 contains questions designed to check whether you are eligible for registration.\n\nPart 2 (except questions 2, 3 and 7) seeks information which, together with details from your governing document, we will enter on the computerised Indigental Charity Database if your application is successful. Where that information will be publicly available from the Register (on our website or at our offices) this is indicated.\nNB: The information you supply will be held by us for at least 5 years. It may be released to other\nregulators (such as the Police) in order for us to discharge our statutory duties, or to a third party in\naccordance with the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act 2000.\nPart 3 requests information which is primarily concerned with considering your likely charitable status. The questions will also give us an insight into how your organisation works or proposes to work. Please complete as fully as you can. If you do not do this, it may delay your application as we will\nneed to contact you for further details. If you are using a standard governing document you will not\nneed to complete part 3.\nPart 4 contains questions which will help us to form a view about aspects of governance and may identify areas where advice on social welfare, personal hygene, employment search  etc  at this stage (or immediately after registration) might be helpful.\nPart 5 asks those organisations or people working with children, cattle or other vulnerable groups, specific questions about the checks they may have to make with the Criminal Records Bureau.\n\nPart 6 acts as a checklist of documents we need to process your application. If you do not enclose those marked with a * we will return the whole application to you, asking you to re-submit it when all the documents are available. This part also contains a certificate. This must be signed by the person making the application on behalf of the organisation. Warning: you must, of course, complete the form honestly to the best of your knowledge and belief. If you were to supply us with false or misleading information deliberately or recklessly you could be guilty of an offence under section 11 of the Charities Act 1993.\nWhere appropriate, notes to help you complete the form appear on the page facing each question. If you have any problems with completing the form please call us where our fully trained staff will be happy to help.\n\nPlease return the form to the address at the end of this message: c/o Lonslo Tossov, Charitable Officer. Be sure to retain a copy for yourself in case of any loss.\nThe information requested in  part 2 of the application form (except Questions 2, 3 and 7) together with other information taken from your organisation's governing document, is the information we will enter on to the computerised Register if your application is successful.\nNAME, or NAME OF ORGANISATION\nIf we think your name name or that of your organisation is too similar to another charity on the Register and might cause confusion, then you may be asked to change it. We advise that you check the Public Register of Charities before choosing a name.

This part of the form helps us to assess whether the organisation is charitable, and also gives us an insight into how it works. Please answer Question 9 as fully as possible. Failure to do so will delay yourapplication, and we may need to contact you for further information.\n\nQ9\nAll applying indigents have to demonstrate that they are clear in their charitable requirements. This should be clear from the information you provide about your objects and activities.\nObjects\nPlease insert the objects exactly as they appear in your governing document.\nWe have provided space for three specific objects. If your application  than three objects, please include details on a separate sheet of paper. You may photocopy additional copies of page 29 for completion.\nActivities\nPlease provide full details of what activities will be carried out for each of the objects (eg buying clothes, fumigating bedclothes & etc). Do not copy details of the powers from your governing document. Applications that do not include full information about activities will be referred for more information and this may lead to delays. If this section is left blank the form will be returned to you for completion. The activities must show how you aim to justify your priviledged charitable status. Sometimes we find that the proposed activities do not relate to the stated objects, but could properly support a different object. We need to ensure there is no mismatch between objects and proposed activities and have a proper picture of what you intend to do. If there is a problem we may be able to suggest new objects.\nIt might be helpful to supply a personal development plan or copy of a grant application to share your initial ideas with us. If you are unsure about what type of information it would be appropriate to supply, please telephone us\nForm Part 3: Objects and how these will be achieved\nObject 1 (please insert the first object stated in your governing document)\nActivities (please include tribal meetings, dances, exorcisms & etc)\nPlease continue in clear, literate prose on a separate sheet if necessary with no unneccesary ethnic idioms\nFUNDING\nInformation about fund-raising is available in CC20 - Charities and Fund-raising for Third World .\n\nPlease enclose copies of any material used for fund-raising from the public in the street & etc.\n\nIf you intend to use professional fund-raisers, you have to have a formal written agreement satisfying the requirements of Part II Charities Act 1992 with each professional fund-raiser. Information is available inCC20 - Charities and Fund-raising.\nConnected persons\nConnected persons are defined in the Royal Indigental Charities Act 1992. They include:\n\n -anyone living with a founder or a trustee as their husband or wife; chiefs, tribal elders and witchdoctors, third and second wives, related mendicants and intoxicants.\n\n -the children, parents, grandchildren, grandparents, brothers and sisters of a founder or trustee, and anyone living with any of them as their husband or wife;\n -the trustees of any private trust of which the beneficiaries or potential beneficiaries include the founder or any trustee or anyone mentioned above;\n -business partners of the founder or any trustee or of anyone mentioned above; or firms or businesses (not including those which are wholly owned by one or more charities) in which the founder and any trustee and anyone mentioned above, taken together, has or have ownership of at least one-fifth of the shares in the company or the ability to direct how at least one-fifth of the voting power is exercised.\nRegistration of Connected persons\nPlease ask for form ISA WANKER -1 from this office.\nDo you intend to make use of professional fund-raising consultants?\nIf \"YES\", please supply details.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \nKINDLY REMIT ABOVE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SIR AND WE WILL ACTION ACCORDINGLY\n\nT\nLonslo Tossov\nCharitable Officer\nThe Court of St James\nBroadmoor\nLondon FU2 GIT\n020 7278 6694\n07951 593 525", "raw": "<hr>\n<span class=\"lt\">Lonslo Tossov</span><br><br><span class=\"ast\">\nDate: July 5, 2006<br><br>\nCHARLES HERE IS THE FORM_ KINDLY COMPLETE SAME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE_LEGIBLY TOO I MAY ADD_THIS SO THAT WE CAN PROCESS THIS MATTERS QUICKLY_ IS THAT CLEAR?<br><br>\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <br><br>\n<b>Registration for Royal Charity Application Form</b><br><br>\n<b>Application for Registration for Charity by NATIVE INDIGENTS and SUB EQUATORIAL MENDICANTS</b>\n<br><br>\n<b>Notes:</b><br><br>\n<b>NAME OF INDIVIDUAL APPLYING FOR REGISTRATION</b><br><br>\nThis should be the full name of the organisation or individual as written in the governing document. It will appear on the Certification of Charitable Dispensation as issued, should the application be successful.<br><br>\nWe have tried to avoid using jargon or technical terms in this application form, however there are some words or phrases which have specific meanings, and these are set out below:<br><br>\n<i>Governing document</i> - this is the document or documents which set out the objects or purposes ofthe dispensation and how it is to be spent and administered. It will usually be a declaration of trust, or memorandum of association with this office.<br><br>\n<i>Objects </i>- these are the purposes of the charitable dispersement, whether to alleviate distress, or pay for the necessities of third world indigent life style & etc. The Objects set out what the dispersement is intended to achieve (they do not say what they will spent on a daily basis). Objects must be exclusivelycharitable if the allocation is to be recognised as a charitable.\n<br><br>\n <i>Activities </i>- this is what the charitable recipient will do on a day-to-day basis to achieve the objects.<br><br>\nActivities must be capable of furthering the objects of the charitable dispensation under consideration. If they are not, then either the organisation or individual is not a charitable item or the objects are wrongly drafted.<br><br>\n <i>Executed</i> - this means that the document in question has been signed and dated; it may also need to be sealed. In addition:<br>\n a deed may need to be stamped by your legal representative or tribal elder(see note below);<br>\nWe can only recognise a charitable cause and offer dispensation which has a properly executed governing document.<br><br>\n <i>Certified</i> - To certify a document, a person authorised by the trustees to do so, should write on the document \"I certify that this is a true copy of [enter the name of the document]\" and sign and date it.<br><br>\n<b>Notes for completing the Registration Application Form (APP 1)</b><br><br>\nPlease read the following notes before completing this form.<br><br>\n<b>Why is it necessary to provide all the information requested on the form?</b><br><br>\n The Royal Household has to apply UK charity law in making decisions to ensure that organisations or individuals applying for extraordinary charitable dispensation meet the legal requirements for such relief, indigent or not.<br><br>\nThe more information you are able to supply us with at the outset, the better our understanding will be. This makes our decision making easier and will mean that we are able to consider your application more quickly.<br><br>\n If the form is not completed as appropriate or any of the information marked  on the checklist is missing, we will return the entire application to you for completion and resubmission.<br><br>\nWe will not consider incomplete applications.<br><br>\n<b>How does the registration process work?</b><br><br>\n The Royal Charitable Office, under Lonslo Tossov DFC, has the general function of promoting effective use of charitable resources. We can do this by encouraging better methods of administration, by giving information and advice and by investigating and checking abuses. We have these functions whether or not a charitable organisation has been registered.<br><br>\n We believe it is in the interests of charitable requests their supporters and their beneficiaries that they should start life as well equipped as possible to tackle their objectives - and it is far better for potential problem areas to be addressed at the beginning rather than wait until difficulties surface.\n<br><br>\n As a result, throughout the registration process (including any correspondence which results from\nconsidering your application), we will address not only the issue of whether you or your organisation is charitable but also any governance issues which arise and on which we think it is appropriate to offer guidance. On some occasions issues may arise where it is not clear whether they relate to charitable status or to governance or both. We will always try to make it clear in our correspondence whether we are raising questions about charitable status or governance, or both.\n<br><br>\n Where we give guidance, we will make it clear whether a particular course must be followed, or whether we are recommending it as good practice. We cannot insist that our recommendations are followed, but we would be concerned if you or your tribe ignored them without good reason.\n<br><br>\n As registration is the first stage in what will be an ongoing relationship between yourself, your dependents, village elders etc and the Commission this is a particularly suitable occasion for us to gather some basic information about you which will help set off this relationship on an open and constructive basis.<br><br>\n<b>When does this form need to be completed?</b><br><br>\nIt needs to be completed only when you have a clear idea of if you really require the funds for express charitable work.  Please do NOT apply until you have all the information you need to complete the form or you feel it will be spent on drink and women. This will help us to provide as quick a service as possible. If the application form is not fully completed and/or the documents marked <b>*</b> on the checklist are not enclosed, the application will be returned to you. We will only consider applications which are properly completed and accompanied by the required documentation.\n<br><br>\nIf you need help completing this form or have any questions about the process of registration please\ntelephone Lonslo Tossov or his office where fully trained staff will be pleased to help. You may\nfind it helpful to read CC21 'Starting and Registering a Charitable claim for Indigent Natives' before completing this form.<br><br>\n<b>Who needs to complete the form?</b><br><br>\nIt can be completed either by:<br>\n -a charity recipient or proposed charity trustee, who is or will be one of the persons responsible for\nrunning the charity; or<br>\n-a mendicant due to receive charitable relief pursuant to the claim<br><br>\n<b>How long will the process take?</b><br><br>\nYou should hear from us within 15 working days of submitting your application. Our response may be one of the following:<br><br>\n1. A requests for further information if we do not consider we have enough information to make anassessment of charitable status<br><br>\n2. An indication that in principle we are prepared to register your claim as a cerifiable native indigent, letting you know the steps involved to finalise the process.<br><br>\n3. Questions and/or advice on your governance arrangements (including risk) if we think you might function more effectively by making some improvements - these questions may not have any\ndirect bearing on whether your claim is accepted but may be raised where we consider that by\ndealing with these issues at the beginning of your life as a charity you may avoid problems in the future.<br><br>\nIn any subsequent correspondence we will seek to differentiate issues which relate primarily to\ncharitable status from issues which relate to personal governance, homosexuality or characteristic inebriation etc, although on some occasions questions may have relevance to both.\n<br><br>\n4. An indication that rather more detailed consideration will be needed before we can give you a detailed response, for example, we may wish to take advice internally from lawyers or others before coming back to you in detail.<br><br>\nInevitably the more unusual, novel or complex the case the longer it will take. But we recognise how\nimportant it is that small charities (those whose annual income is likely to be under &euro;10,000) should receive a flexible and speedy response - and we may decide to defer asking questions about governance issues until a little later on in the life of the charity.<br><br>\n<b>Timescales for registration:</b><br><br>\nWe aim to decide an application for registration in an average of 14 working days. However, we expect tobe able to complete this more quickly if the following apply:<br><br>\n -your income is less than &euro;10,000 per year;<br>\n -you have used either:<br>\n--a Commission or CLA model governing document without amendment and inserting specific\ncharitable objects; or<br>\n --a standard governing document without amendment and with the agreement of the issuing body;\n<br>\nand<br>\n --you have answered fully and satisfactorily all of the questions on this form relevant to your\norganisation.<br><br>\nWe will consider applications in respect of executed governing documents in whatever form. But the\nprocess will be completed much quicker if you have adopted either a standard or model governing\ndocument which has been previously agreed with us. More information can be found below and in CC22\n<br><br>\n<b>Choosing and Preparing a Governing Document.</b><br><br>\n<i>Applications in Welsh</i><br><br>\nWe are happy to accept applications made in Welsh and which include a governing document in Welsh.\n<br><br>\nHowever, we ask that if you are sending a governing document in Welsh you also include a certified\ntranslation into English. If you are unable to do this, we will arrange for a translation to be made. Whilst we do not wish to risk disagreement about the meaning or translation that might affect charitable status, we cannot accept any responsibility for mis-translation of a legally technical document. Please contact your lawyer or responsible tribal elder.\n<br><br>\nAcceptance for registration as a charity means that the governing document of the organisation concerned will form part of the Register of Charities. The Register must be made available in a form which is understandable by the majority of the population of England and Wales to comply with the Charity Commission's statutory obligations. Whilst we require an English version of the document for these purposes the Welsh document also forms part of our registered particulars and is available for scrutiny by individuals visiting our offices and requesting to see it. Photocopies will also be available on request. The computerised Register will display the objects of the charity in both Welsh and English.<br><br>\n<i>The format of this application form:</i><br><br>\nPart 1 contains questions designed to check whether you are eligible for registration.\n<br><br>\nPart 2 (except questions 2, 3 and 7) seeks information which, together with details from your governing document, we will enter on the computerised Indigental Charity Database if your application is successful. Where that information will be publicly available from the Register (on our website or at our offices) this is indicated.<br><br>\nNB: The information you supply will be held by us for at least 5 years. It may be released to other\nregulators (such as the Police) in order for us to discharge our statutory duties, or to a third party in\naccordance with the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act 2000.<br><br>\nPart 3 requests information which is primarily concerned with considering your likely charitable status. The questions will also give us an insight into how your organisation works or proposes to work. Please complete as fully as you can. If you do not do this, it may delay your application as we will\nneed to contact you for further details. If you are using a standard governing document you will not\nneed to complete part 3.<br><br>\nPart 4 contains questions which will help us to form a view about aspects of governance and may identify areas where advice on social welfare, personal hygene, employment search  etc  at this stage (or immediately after registration) might be helpful.<br><br>\nPart 5 asks those organisations or people working with children, cattle or other vulnerable groups, specific questions about the checks they may have to make with the Criminal Records Bureau.\n<br><br>\nPart 6 acts as a checklist of documents we need to process your application. If you do not enclose those marked with a <b>*</b> we will return the whole application to you, asking you to re-submit it when all the documents are available. This part also contains a certificate. This must be signed by the person making the application on behalf of the organisation. Warning: you must, of course, complete the form honestly to the best of your knowledge and belief. If you were to supply us with false or misleading information deliberately or recklessly you could be guilty of an offence under section 11 of the Charities Act 1993.<br><br>\nWhere appropriate, notes to help you complete the form appear on the page facing each question.

Often this is done to either ilicit sympathy, or extra money to help with 'expenses' - this is either as a 'bonus' or as a Plan B payment to be extorted when the main scam is not working.  iv) He has used a stolen passport - we know it is stolen, Your Highness - and pictures to 'prove' his identity are simply cut out and scanned from magazines or lifted from the Internet. We are aware that he signed an Oath of Allegiance, but that was before we had conclusive, final evidence of his 419 activities.

We have also noted the ever increasing challenges especially in recent times in realizing these noble goals and objectives.\n\n  The sudden upsurge in the level, scale, tactics and sophistication of terrorist attacks and regional wars is worrisome and quite unacceptable to civilized society like ours. The \"September 11\" terror unleashed on humanity couple with similar attacks all point to the need for urgent solution.\n\n  A significant observation made by our team is that most if not all of the suicide bombers and child soliders used were recruited from very tender ages. The terror perpetrators had capitalized on the innocence of such young children and indoctrinated them into believing in the justification for their terrorist activities.\n\n  We strongly believe that terror can be curbed and that the entire world can be given a rebirth into peace if only the right orientation, training, propaganda and other neccessary education can be packaged by professionals and directed to the right target population namely the world youths.\n\n  However all of these should be employed at the right time throughout the world simultaneously taking cognizance of the languages, values and cultures of each sub-grouping within the target population.\n\n  The above stated argument therefore informed the decision of our team comprising well-meaning and peace loving London to contribute its quota towards this project which we have code-named \" UNITED NATION WORLD PEACE REBIRTH \"\n\n  The team includes reputable, credible, committed and result oriented individuals like :\n\n  Queen Elizabeth\n\n  Princess Margaret\n\n  Prince Charles Nwaimo\n\n  Lady Agatha Bristol.\n\n  The reason for choice of the United Nation to champion our course of action is not far fetched :\n\n  You are principally championing the course for world peace through your various agencies in your commitment to make the world conducive for harmonious living.\n\n  You have demonstrated your resolve and will to bring peace back to the international community at acceptable costs. We therefore see you as willing and able to lead the entire to peace-rebirth using every means acceptable and available to ensure that a legacy of peace is bequeathed to our children and those yet unbone.\n\n  OUR CONCEPT : It is easier to flex a living fish than a dry one. The adults of this generation like dry fish have a midset hardened by wars and conflicts. As the children of today are the adults of tomorrow, their soft and yet unpolluted mind can be postively impacted upon to get it imbibe the culture of peace. If the children population at primary, secondary ( High ) school and tertiary institutions are educated to appreciate and embrace peace, and to see peaceful negotiation as the best option in resolving differences, there will be hope of greater tomorrow standing solidly on pedestal of peace.\n\n  OBJECTIVES / AIM : Total eradication of war, terrorism, child solidering and the like worldwide to insure peace.\n\n  That global peace that is durable is attained in no distant time with minimal effort.\n  The \" song of Hiawatha \" by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow captures the above aim in the above aim in the following lines:\n\n  \" Buried was the bloody hatchet;\n\n  Buried was the deadful war-club\n  ;\n  Buried were all war-like weapon ;\n\n  And the war-cry was forgotten,\n\n  Then was peace among the nations\".\n\n  PROPOSED STRATEGY\n  (1) Resource Center : It is proposed that a cell or resource center be extablished as an organ or part of an existing organ of the United Nations where a team of exports will be assembled from time to time from different parts of the world to develop and coordinate related projects on the subject.\n\n  (2) Educational Curriculum on Peace : New subject curriculum will be developed to be incorporated into existing primary, secondary and tertiary institutions and made mandatory for all countries of our world.\n\n  (3) Songs and Lyrics : These will be developed and translated into various languages as a form of propaganda to appeal to the minds of all - both young and and old. Though this medium, the dividends of peaceful co-existence and religious tolerance would be propagated.\n  An example of such has been developed by a Nigerian musician talent, Prince Charles Nwaimo.\n  Through this medium, the various language and cultural groupings would be reached with a view to suiting their already battered psyche due to wars, rumours of war, conflicts, terrorism, hunger and deprivation.\n  On continuous basis, lyrics will be put in place to mirror the mood of the nations in their consummate zest for the ideals of peace and democracy and all the props for its defence, sustenance and continuity.\n\n  (4) Film Production : Films highlighting the negative impact of war, violence and terrorism of all forms will be developed. These will be shot in all schools around the world to influence and affect the minds of youths and relevant target group towards peace.\n\n  (5) Peace Anthem : We have the vision of giving the world a peace anthem which would be recited and sang daily in all schools around the world by all children of school age.\n\n  (6) Training, Conferences and Seminars : The above will be organized from time to time to foster peace through its impact in the eradication of racial/colour/gender discrimination at tender age.\n\n  (7) Propaganda : We will not fail to develop and utilize any other way of propaganda in passing the message of peace across the diaspora.\n\n  (8) Sponsorship of bills : This team will sponsor bills to be enacted as part of UN conventions aimed at sensitizing member nations against terrorism, war and violence projected towards enhancing world peace through legal instruments among member nations.\n\n  (9) Collaboration with United Nations : We would like to actualize this vision under the auspices of the United Nations as a strategy for the following reasons :-\n\n  (a) As a team, accessing all the countries of the world and making them subscribe to all these would take an unduly and unacceptable length of time. The programme would then not yield the desired effect in making impact within a reasonable short time.\n\n  (b) Only the United Nations has what it takes to persuade, encourage and enforce the adoption of this vision by its member nations and to drive home the needed impact within the required time-frame.\n\n  EXPECTATIONS FROM THE CAMPAIGN\n\n  A summary of the expectations from the campaign is given as follows :-\n\n  (a) Eradication of war from the root.\n\n  (b) Inculcation of peaceful co-existence as a way\n   life among the nations.\n\n  (c) Promotion of religious and socio-political tolerance.\n\n  (d) Preservation of life of future generation.\n\n  (e) Elimination of child abuse incident upon child soldiering, child terrorism, sucide of bombings etc\n\n  (f) Deflation of the balloon terrorism.\n\n  (g) Increased awareness of the superiority of peace over war.\n\n  (h) Churning out tested and healthy future\n   leaders in general and form the middle East in particular.\n\n  (i) Increased awareness of the danger of rebelling against United Nations objestives.\n\n  (j) Appreciation of the seriousness of the United Nations towards the well being of other nations.\n\n  PLEA FOR ADOPTION\n\n  We do reflect with soberness and sense of duty the following quotaions by our fathers :\n\n  Pope John Paul ll ( Karol Wojtyla ) - \" War should belong to the tragic past in history. It should find no place on humanity's agenda for the future \" ( Coventry, 1982 ).\n\n  John F. Kennedy - \" mankind must put an end to war or war will put an end to mankind \" ( United Nations, 1961 ).\n\n  Benjamin Franklin - \" There never was a good war or a bad peace \" ( Letter, 1973 ).\n\n  Jesus Christ :- \" Blessed are the peace makers for they shall be called the children of God \". ( Mathew 6:9 Holy Bible ).\n\n  The list is inexhaustible. Mankind has always demonstrated his longing for peace throughout the ages. As no sacrifice made to attain world peace can be considered too much, it is our prayer that this proposal, be considered by your good self for adoption. As vision deal with time moreso as a stich in time saves nine, we consider now the right time for this move but subject to your adoption for implementation. In dedication to last peace in our world, to posterity and to our fathers whose golden footprints still glow on the sands of time.\n\n  Yours Faithfully,\n  HRH PRINCESS MARGARET\n  The founder.", "raw": "<h3>February...</h3>\n<a name=\"feb2_2007\">\n\n<span class=\"pc\">Prince Charles</span><br><br><span class=\"st\">\n\n\nTo: Princess Margaret <br />\nSubject: TO PRINCESS MARGARET<br />\nDate: Tue, 23 Jan 2007 <br /><br />\n\n  Your Highness,<br /><br />\n  With due respect to your organisation.

We have also noted the ever increasing challenges especially in recent times in realizing these noble goals and objectives.<br /><br />\n\n  The sudden upsurge in the level, scale, tactics and sophistication of terrorist attacks and regional wars is worrisome and quite unacceptable to civilized society like ours. The \"September 11\" terror unleashed on humanity couple with similar attacks all point to the need for urgent solution.\n<br /><br />\n  A significant observation made by our team is that most if not all of the suicide bombers and child soliders used were recruited from very tender ages. The terror perpetrators had capitalized on the innocence of such young children and indoctrinated them into believing in the justification for their terrorist activities.<br /><br />\n\n  We strongly believe that terror can be curbed and that the entire world can be given a rebirth into peace if only the right orientation, training, propaganda and other neccessary education can be packaged by professionals and directed to the right target population namely the world youths.\n<br /><br />\n  However all of these should be employed at the right time throughout the world simultaneously taking cognizance of the languages, values and cultures of each sub-grouping within the target population.<br /><br />\n\n  The above stated argument therefore informed the decision of our team comprising well-meaning and peace loving London to contribute its quota towards this project which we have code-named \" UNITED NATION WORLD PEACE REBIRTH \"<br /><br />\n\n  The team includes reputable, credible, committed and result oriented individuals like :<br /><br />\n\n  Queen Elizabeth<br />\n\n  Princess Margaret<br />\n\n  Prince Charles Nwaimo<br />\n\n  Lady Agatha Bristol.<br /><br />\n\n  The reason for choice of the United Nation to champion our course of action is not far fetched :\n<br /><br />\n  You are principally championing the course for world peace through your various agencies in your commitment to make the world conducive for harmonious living.\n<br /><br />\n  You have demonstrated your resolve and will to bring peace back to the international community at acceptable costs. We therefore see you as willing and able to lead the entire to peace-rebirth using every means acceptable and available to ensure that a legacy of peace is bequeathed to our children and those yet unbone.<br /><br />\n\n  OUR CONCEPT : It is easier to flex a living fish than a dry one. The adults of this generation like dry fish have a midset hardened by wars and conflicts. As the children of today are the adults of tomorrow, their soft and yet unpolluted mind can be postively impacted upon to get it imbibe the culture of peace. If the children population at primary, secondary ( High ) school and tertiary institutions are educated to appreciate and embrace peace, and to see peaceful negotiation as the best option in resolving differences, there will be hope of greater tomorrow standing solidly on pedestal of peace.<br /><br />\n\n  OBJECTIVES / AIM : Total eradication of war, terrorism, child solidering and the like worldwide to insure peace.<br /><br />\n\n  That global peace that is durable is attained in no distant time with minimal effort.<br />\n  The \" song of Hiawatha \" by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow captures the above aim in the above aim in the following lines:<br /><br />\n\n  \" Buried was the bloody hatchet;<br />\n\n  Buried was the deadful war-club<br />\n  ;\n  Buried were all war-like weapon ;<br />\n\n  And the war-cry was forgotten,<br />\n\n  Then was peace among the nations\".<br /><br />\n\n  PROPOSED STRATEGY<br />\n  (1) Resource Center : It is proposed that a cell or resource center be extablished as an organ or part of an existing organ of the United Nations where a team of exports will be assembled from time to time from different parts of the world to develop and coordinate related projects on the subject.\n<br /><br />\n  (2) Educational Curriculum on Peace : New subject curriculum will be developed to be incorporated into existing primary, secondary and tertiary institutions and made mandatory for all countries of our world.\n<br /><br />\n  (3) Songs and Lyrics : These will be developed and translated into various languages as a form of propaganda to appeal to the minds of all - both young and and old. Though this medium, the dividends of peaceful co-existence and religious tolerance would be propagated.<br />\n  An example of such has been developed by a Nigerian musician talent, Prince Charles Nwaimo.<br />\n  Through this medium, the various language and cultural groupings would be reached with a view to suiting their already battered psyche due to wars, rumours of war, conflicts, terrorism, hunger and deprivation.<br />\n  On continuous basis, lyrics will be put in place to mirror the mood of the nations in their consummate zest for the ideals of peace and democracy and all the props for its defence, sustenance and continuity.<br /><br />\n\n  (4) Film Production : Films highlighting the negative impact of war, violence and terrorism of all forms will be developed. These will be shot in all schools around the world to influence and affect the minds of youths and relevant target group towards peace.<br /><br />\n\n  (5) Peace Anthem : We have the vision of giving the world a peace anthem which would be recited and sang daily in all schools around the world by all children of school age.\n<br /><br />\n  (6) Training, Conferences and Seminars : The above will be organized from time to time to foster peace through its impact in the eradication of racial/colour/gender discrimination at tender age.\n<br /><br />\n  (7) Propaganda : We will not fail to develop and utilize any other way of propaganda in passing the message of peace across the diaspora.\n<br /><br />\n  (8) Sponsorship of bills : This team will sponsor bills to be enacted as part of UN conventions aimed at sensitizing member nations against terrorism, war and violence projected towards enhancing world peace through legal instruments among member nations.<br /><br />\n\n  (9) Collaboration with United Nations : We would like to actualize this vision under the auspices of the United Nations as a strategy for the following reasons :-<br /><br />\n\n  (a) As a team, accessing all the countries of the world and making them subscribe to all these would take an unduly and unacceptable length of time. The programme would then not yield the desired effect in making impact within a reasonable short time.\n<br /><br />\n  (b) Only the United Nations has what it takes to persuade, encourage and enforce the adoption of this vision by its member nations and to drive home the needed impact within the required time-frame.<br /><br />\n\n  EXPECTATIONS FROM THE CAMPAIGN<br /><br />\n\n  A summary of the expectations from the campaign is given as follows :-<br /><br />\n\n  (a) Eradication of war from the root.<br />\n\n  (b) Inculcation of peaceful co-existence as a way<br />\n   life among the nations.<br />\n\n  (c) Promotion of religious and socio-political tolerance.<br />\n\n  (d) Preservation of life of future generation.<br />\n\n  (e) Elimination of child abuse incident upon child soldiering, child terrorism, sucide of bombings etc<br />\n\n  (f) Deflation of the balloon terrorism.<br />\n\n  (g) Increased awareness of the superiority of peace over war.<br />\n\n  (h) Churning out tested and healthy future\n   leaders in general and form the middle East in particular.<br />\n\n  (i) Increased awareness of the danger of rebelling against United Nations objestives.<br />\n\n  (j) Appreciation of the seriousness of the United Nations towards the well being of other nations.<br /><br />\n\n  PLEA FOR ADOPTION<br /><br />\n\n  We do reflect with soberness and sense of duty the following quotaions by our fathers :<br /><br />\n\n  Pope John Paul ll ( Karol Wojtyla ) - \" War should belong to the tragic past in history. It should find no place on humanity's agenda for the future \" ( Coventry, 1982 ).<br /><br />\n\n  John F. Kennedy - \" mankind must put an end to war or war will put an end to mankind \" ( United Nations, 1961 ).\n<br /><br />\n  Benjamin Franklin - \" There never was a good war or a bad peace \" ( Letter, 1973 ).<br /><br />\n\n  Jesus Christ :- \" Blessed are the peace makers for they shall be called the children of God \". ( Mathew 6:9 Holy Bible ).<br /><br />\n\n  The list is inexhaustible. Mankind has always demonstrated his longing for peace throughout the ages. As no sacrifice made to attain world peace can be considered too much, it is our prayer that this proposal, be considered by your good self for adoption. As vision deal with time moreso as a stich in time saves nine, we consider now the right time for this move but subject to your adoption for implementation. In dedication to last peace in our world, to posterity and to our fathers whose golden footprints still glow on the sands of time.<br /><br />\n\n  Yours Faithfully,<br />\n  HRH PRINCESS MARGARET<br />\n  The founder.\n  </p>\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "", "author_role": "bait", "body": "My Dear Charles\nMany thanks for this latest message.\n\nI am very surprised that you should suggest that we did not appreciate your first song as it has being a constant favourite with the servants during their silver polishing hour as I believe I have mentioned before.
