He did not share much about the transaction, but asked me to follow through however I could.\n\nPlease provide me with any details concerning this  transaction that you feel are appropriate. I am authorized, through a power of attorney to conduct all business for Mr. Addams and his Penguin Farm, including payments of outstanding debts.\n\nI apologize for the unfortunate diversion in Mr. Addam's participation, and hope that you will feel free to deal with me.\n\nDigory\n\nPS.

not worry about  this.But your\njoke about my being one of the biggest penguins owner is upsetting me. \nThe largest penguin I have at the moment has grown to almost 6 feet in\nheight.This is very disturbing, and very unnatural.I heard from some\nlocals over in Baker that this area had been used for biological weapons\nwarfare testing some years back, and I am now wondering if this mutation\nmay be caused by chemicals in the area.The 6 foot penguins will have\nto be put down, as they don't really fit in with the rest of the\npopulation, and are accidentally causing damage to the facility and some\nof the other penguins.\n<br><br>\nDoodoo has contacted me, and wants me to send three separate payments of\n$3500 each.This is very strange, I have not heard of a lawyer working\nlike this before.Is this  OK?<br><br>\n\nCharles\n\n\n</span>\n\n<br><br>\n\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "", "author_role": "scam", "body":
