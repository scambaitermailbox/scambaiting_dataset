Well, I am Barrister Jita Hali, the personal resident Attorney here in Burkina Faso to Mr. Sheu Yuan-dong, the late governor of Taiwan's Central Bank, his wife and only daughter with other four other finance officials returning from a conference in Bali Died in a plane crash in Taiwan on February 16, 1998. My client was having an abandon sum of Thirty Million Five Hundred thousand united state dollars ($30.5m USD) with Bank of Africa, Burkina Faso.\n\n   The fact and confidentially, this sum kept here very secret while nobody knows except his wife, as he was a governor of Taiwan's Central Bank, anything can happen, so he kept this money here in case of emergency. Unfortunately he lost his live with his family in the event of the plane crash, since then I have made several enquiries to locate any of my client relatives but all my efforts were unsuccessful.\n\n   Above all, since nobody is coming for it and I don't want this money to go into the banks treasury as an unclaimed bill. Because the banking law and guidelines here stipulated that if such money remained unclaimed after eight (8) years the money will be transferred into the bank treasury as an unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a\n  Foreigner and a Burkina be cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.\n\n   View this website: http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9802/16/taiwan.crash.update2/ After all these, I decided to trace his relatives over the Internet, to locate any member of his family but of no avail, hence I contacted you to assist me in repatriating the balance of late Mr. Sheu left behind to you as his real next of kin. For your assistance, I agree to offer you 30% as my foreign partner after the money will be transfer into your nominated bank account and 5% will be aside of any expenses during the transfer.\n  Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of the fund to you as indicated, you must apply first to the bank as his next of kin, indicating your bank information where the money will be remitted. It may interest you to note that I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to backup the claim.\n\n   All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us seeing this deal through.
