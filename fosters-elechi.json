to you that I don't know if my brother Kenny will survive or not because there is not adequate treatment because I don't have money to take him to hospital and the sickness gets increasing Answers to your question\n\n\nFirst I remember I told you in one of my previous letters that your country Australia is an advanced country with good governance that every activity is been controlled and monitored by government rule of law but here it is not like that we don't have control price in transport affairs more especially motor transport they decide what they will take because we don't have good road to operate and the cars and trucks they use here is fairly used motors being brought from oversea countries by individuals $750 dollars was mapped out from the money as you requested that I should explain how I am going to use the money, not that I have gotten a house already it will be when you give us the money after getting a house that will be when I will travel to get this properties like I stated\n\n\nIn oversea countries like I know when somebody pays for an apartment is likely every amenities will be in the house all what the person need is to enter the house with his cloths and other relevant things like documents but here it is not so here we only rent an empty house and provide yourself with properties\n\n\nNot that I am going home to carry all the properties I sent home NO it is the important and necessary ones we will use before I mapped out $750 I have made an enquirers for it\n\n\nSecondly I thank you very much for finding out from the school website why I needed to get accommodation in the school is that I cannot be going to school from Lagos to port Harcourt 8hrs journey everyday how will I coup with my studies that is why I needed to get accommodation in the school so that I can meet up with my studies and other activities The accommodation in Lagos is where we will leave\n\n\nMy brother Kenny is in ss1 in secondary school I have explained it to you several times that I don't have money otherwise I would have sent you the picture\n\n\nSometimes promises makes someone to be happy and hopeful and also makes someone to be more prayerful Alotta whatever I can do to make you happy apart from prayers I always pray for you I will do it to make you happy you are mother\n\n\nThank you very much for being an

JUNE 25TH 4:08AM\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDear Alotta,\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOnce again thank you for acknowledging my apology and for playing a mother's role be bless and have a son's kiss twice\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFirst I must be sincere to you that I don't know if my brother Kenny will survive or not because there is not adequate treatment because I don't have money to take him to hospital and the sickness gets increasing Answers to your question\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFirst I remember I told you in one of my previous letters that your country Australia is an advanced country with good governance that every activity is been controlled and monitored by government rule of law but here it is not like that we don't have control price in transport affairs more especially motor transport they decide what they will take because we don't have good road to operate and the cars and trucks they use here is fairly used motors being brought from oversea countries by individuals $750 dollars was mapped out from the money as you requested that I should explain how I am going to use the money, not that I have gotten a house already it will be when you give us the money after getting a house that will be when I will travel to get this properties like I stated\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn oversea countries like I know when somebody pays for an apartment is likely every amenities will be in the house all what the person need is to enter the house with his cloths and other relevant things like documents but here it is not so here we only rent an empty house and provide yourself with properties\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNot that I am going home to carry all the properties I sent home NO it is the important and necessary ones we will use before I mapped out $750 I have made an enquirers for it\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSecondly I thank you very much for finding out from the school website why I needed to get accommodation in the school is that I cannot be going to school from Lagos to port Harcourt 8hrs journey everyday how will I coup with my studies that is why I needed to get accommodation in the school so that I can meet up with my studies and other activities The accommodation in Lagos is where we will leave\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMy brother Kenny is in ss1 in secondary school I have explained it to you several times that I don't have money otherwise I would have sent you the picture\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSometimes promises makes someone to be happy and hopeful and also makes someone to be more prayerful Alotta whatever I can do to make you happy apart from prayers I always pray for you I will do it to make you happy you are mother\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThank you very much for being an understanding mother\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMarins\n</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"afc\"> [.... the idea of him kissing me even once---ewww, makes me want to take a
