Since his death and even prior to the announcement, I have been thrown into a state of antagonism, confusion, humiliation, frustration and hopelessness by the present leadership of the Palestinian Liberation Organization and the new Prime Minister. I have even been subjected to physical and psychological torture. As a widow that is so traumatized*, I have lost confidence with everybody in the country at the moment, and for this reason I and my only daughter had to flee to Tunisia to live.\n\nI had been living in Tunisia ever since my husband died in 2004 until recently I was expulsed from the country over some political and controversial issues which also resulted in confiscation of all my assets and business investments and frozen of my bank accounts. I knew it was a plot and perfected arrangement from the presidency to push me out of a large business cartel I am in control of in Tunisia . Well I am not surprise of this development, although I have relocated to Valletta Malta where I am presently residing to begin a new life with my only daughter.\n\nPlease I am writing you this email with a heart full of pains and sorrow, and for the reasons of all I have stated above, I would want you to treat this email and its content very confidential and under no circumstances would you disclose this to anyone. And I also want to inform you that I have been under security surveillances since after the death of my husband because of some undisclosable bank accounts and funds deposited in some investment firm in my name. It is based on this fact that I am asking for a total confidentiality of this transaction, as I have not any intention to expose you to any danger or risks.\n\nI am therefore soliciting for your help to assist me for the retrieval of all these deposits from the various bank accounts and investment firms on my behalf under my power of attorney. I cannot do this by myself because any move I would do to get it done by myself would attract public and government interest on me and this absolutely would result in confiscation of the funds; and it is for this reason that I need to front you to act as my trustee and receivership beneficiary for all the deposits. By this, there would not be any attracted security attention towards me, and this would give us a successful finish.\n\nThe total funds in general are amounting to $850 million United States dollars. But we shall start with the retrieval of the smallest portfolio deposit valued $50 million United States dollars with an investment firm in the Netherlands ; and thereafter followed by retrieval of other deposits in Luxemburg and France.\n\nPlease be informed that the retrieval of these deposits would require your physical presence at the office complex of the investment firm for practical signing of the receivership documents. And having understood the circumstances I have narrated above; I would plead that you take absolute responsibility of the expenses of your traveling and that associated with the retrieval of the portfolio from the firm. You have my authorization and mandate to reimburse yourself all expenses you've made from the funds instantaneously is handed over to you.\n\nI plead for your acceptance of my offer without minding the atrocities my husband has committed in the past during his life time. I want you to consider my offer as a business deal between us, and I am offering you 40% of the total funds for your kind assistance and cooperation. But in case you don't accept my offer, please do not let me out to the security and international media as I am giving you this information in total trust and confidence.
