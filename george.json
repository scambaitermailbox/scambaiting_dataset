I cannot give you \n              a firm commitment as to the amount of the donation we can send to \n              you to help others, but it is normal in these types of cases for \n              my church to offer sums of between $40,000 to $60,000 if you are \n              indeed serious about helping us to spread the word of our ministry. \n              Of course, in order to receive such financial help you must become \n              a full and willing member of our church.<br>\n              <br>\n              Again I must repeat I that to enter our ranks does take great commitment. \n              All members of our church (myself included) must bear the tattoo \n              mark of our saint, Saint Bartholomew Shiver. As an example I have \n              attached a photograph of the tattoo mark as shown on our latest \n              inductee, Mary Clifford. This mark of faith is tattooed on to each \n              individual member of our church. Not only does this serve as a graphic \n              reminder of our commitment to our faith, but all over the world \n              it helps us to recognise our brothers and sisters. It is a golden \n              rule of our church that our members must do everything in their \n              power to help and aid fellow members. <br>\n              <br>\n              So, to be inducted into our church, you must agree to the following:<br>\n              <br>\n              1. Agree to have a tattoo showing the mark and name of Saint Bartholomew \n              Shiver. This can be placed on any part of your body. Most of our \n              members have this placed on their arms.<br>\n              2. Provide photographic proof of the tattoo mark <br>\n              3. Agree to use any donations sent to you for the good of your fellow \n              men &amp; women.<br>\n              <br>\n              If you can agree to the above requirements then I see no reason \n              why we cannot start your induction procedure immediately. On receipt \n              of the photographic proof of your tattoo mark of St. Bartholomew \n              we can provide you with a generous donation and regular help within \n              24 hours of receiving the photographic proof. We will also of course \n              send much information by posts contain our scriptures, information \n              about the church, and how we would like you to help spread word \n              of our church and cause.<br>\n              <br>\n              Of course agreeing to have a tattoo placed upon your body is a very \n              important one, and committing yourself to this is a great request, \n              but it is exactly this which will show us your willingness to be \n              a part of our ministry.<br>\n              <br>\n              Please note that you must be able to fund the tattoo and photographs \n              yourself.

Agree to use any donations sent to you for the good of your fellow\nmen & women.\n\nIf you can agree to the above requirements then I see no reason\nwhy we cannot start your induction procedure immediately. On receipt\nof the photographic proof of your tattoo mark of St. Bartholomew\nwe can provide you with a generous donation and regular help within\n24 hours of receiving the photographic proof. We will also of course\nsend much information by posts contain our scriptures, information\nabout the church, and how we would like you to help spread word\nof our church and cause.\n\nOf course agreeing to have a tattoo placed upon your body is a very\nimportant one, and committing yourself to this is a great request,\nbut it is exactly this which will show us your willingness to be\na part of our ministry.\n\nPlease note that you must be able to fund the tattoo and photographs\nyourself. We will of course refund you all your costs as well as\nprovide the donation to you, however this can only be given once\nthe induction procedure has been completed successfully.\n\nLet me know if you are in agreement to the above requirements and\nI will forward you more detailed information and also a picture\nof the tattoo mark of St. Bartholomew so that you can make your\nown arrangements to have the tattoo applied at your place of choosing.\n\nThank you again for your email.\n\nGod be with you,\n\nFather Bruce Corbin\nAccounts Department\nHoly Church of The Tattooed Saint\n\n\n\n", "to_name": "George Ochonogor", "author_role": "bait"}, {"date": "November 19, 2005", "subject": "I WILL JOING YOUR CHURCH SIR", "raw": "            <p align=\"left\"><b>From:</b> George Ochonogor<br>\n              <b>To:</b> Father Bruce Corbin<br>\n              <b>Date:</b> November 19, 2005<br>\n              <b>Subject:</b> I WILL JOING YOUR CHURCH SIR</p>\n            <p align=\"left\"><i>DEAR FATHER BRUCE CORBIN,</i></p>\n            <p align=\"left\"><i>GREETINGS TO YOU SIR,MAY THE LORD ALWAYS BE WITH \n              YOU FOREVER.THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALL WHAT YOU HAVE DONE FOR ME \n              TO BECOME YOUR MEMBER AND TO SPREAD YOUR GOSPEL HERE IN NIGERIA.</i></p>\n            <p align=\"left\"><i>SIR I AGREE TO HAVE A TATTOO SHOWING THE MARK AND \n              NAME OF SAINT BARTHOLOMEW SHIVER.</i></p>\n            <p><i> WHAT WILL I USED TO DRAW MY OWN TATTOOO IN ANYPART OF MY BODY,IS \n              IT THE TATOO IN THE LADY ARM ON YOUR ATTACH PICTURE, HOPE IS THE \n              SAME THING THAT I WILL ALSO DRAW IN MY OWN ARM.

In other words, being a real \n              tattoo you will of course have it with you for life, so it is important \n              that you are absolutely sure and happy about your decision to join \n              our church. <br>\n              <br>\n              Of course, as you will know, real tattoos leave slight scarring \n              for the first few days until they heal. Photos MUST be supplied \n              so as to provide proof that a real tattoo has been applied. Sadly, \n              some people have tried to fool us by applying fake tattoos, but \n              I must warn you that our four man board are extremely diligent and \n              can recognise a fake tattoo very easily. If your tattoo shop need \n              it, we are happy to provide them with payment for their services \n              and allowing you to take photographs. Payment to the tattoo shop \n              can be up to US $1,000.

All you need to do is ensure the tattoo is \n              large and clear enough to be photographed clearly. Places that our \n              members usually choose are: arms, top of the legs, or back shoulders.<br>\n              <br>\n              <br>\n              VERY IMPORTANT<br>\n              <br>\n              I must stress to you again that the tattoo must be real, and the \n              photographs you send will be inspected very carefully to ensure \n              that they are.

This \n              is a very simple form which the applicant must complete ad sign \n              with their name and date. Once the form has been returned to us \n              then your donation payment can be processed within 24 hours and \n              sent to you by whichever method best suits your means. <br>\n              <br>\n              I offer one piece of advice brother; the board members usually give \n              larger donations depending on the size of the tattoo. So the larger \n              the tattoo the larger the donation payment is liable to be, but \n              the very minimum we send to help is $40,000 so as you can so you \n              will be able to do a lot of very good work with such an amount. \n              Of course, once you become a member you will be invited to our yearly \n              gathering here in the UK (your flight fees and expenses will of \n              course be paid by us) and you will be able to meet many of our members \n              and well as myself.<br>\n              <br>\n              I hope that explains things clearly to you brother, and if you have \n              any questions please feel free to contact me any time.<br>\n              <br>\n              Please will you reply to this email as soon as possible to let me \n              know when you expect to be able to email me the photographs. The \n              four board members work all across the UK so they will need to be \n              gathered to examine your photographs and make the donation payment. \n              This may take 2 or 3 days, so if I know in advance when you are \n              likely to be ready to send the photographs I can ensure that the \n              board members are gathered together in readiness for your photographs.<br>\n              <br>\n              Please also let me know by what means you would prefer the donation \n              payment to be made.<br>\n              <br>\n              God be with you, <br>\n              <br>\n              Father Bruce Corbin <br>\n              Accounts Department <br>\n              Holy Church of The Tattooed Saint </p>\n            <p align=\"left\">I attach the logo of the Tattooed Saint:</p>\n            <p align=\"left\"><img src=\"../images/church_logo.gif\" width=\"220\" height=\"220\"> \n            </p>\n            <p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p>\n", "comments": [], "from_name": "Father Bruce Corbin", "body": "\nDear brother Ochonogor,\n\nThank you so much for your reply.\n\nAs you have requested, the induction information is as follows.\nPlease take care to follow the procedures very carefully.
