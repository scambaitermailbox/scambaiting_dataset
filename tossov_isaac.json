I think, to be honest, that we are probably of too different ages for a happy union although you look delightful, with a full bodied, child-bearing figure. Also I would want a woman who was clean, virginal and, most importantly, doctrinally sound.\n\n\nThank you for your address. Do you want me to put together an aid package as I previously suggested?\n\n\nIt also occurs to me that I may have to get my superior's permission before going a stage further. Bishop Drifte is known to take an interest in any large donations which are likely in our parish and it is best he is involved.\n\n \nRev T", "Articles I to VIII\n\nArticle I\nOf faith in the Holy Trinity\nThere is but one living and true God, everlasting, without body, parts, or passions; of infinite power, wisdom, and goodness; the maker and preserver of all things both visible and invisible. And in unity of this Godhead there be three Persons, of one substance, power, and eternity; the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. \n\n\n\n\nArticle II\nOf the Word, or Son of God, which was made very man\nThe Son, which is the Word of the Father, begotten from everlasting of the Father, the very and eternal God, and of one substance with the Father, took man's nature in the womb of the blessed Virgin, of her substance: so that two whole and perfect natures, that is to say, the Godhead and manhood, were joined together in one person, never to be divided, whereof is one Christ, very God and very man, who truly suffered, was crucified, dead, and buried, to reconcile His Father to us, and to be a sacrifice, not only for original guilt, but also for all actual sins of men. \n\n\n\nArticle III\nOf the going down of Christ into Hell\nAs Christ died for us, and was buried, so also is it to be believed that He went down into Hell. \nArticle IV\nOf the Resurrection of Christ\nChrist did truly rise again from death, and took again His body, with flesh, bones, and all things appertaining to the perfection of man's nature, wherefore He ascended into heaven, and there sitteth until He return to judge all men at the last day. \nArticle V\nOf the Holy Ghost\nThe Holy Ghost, proceeding from the Father and the Son, is of one substance, majesty, and glory with the Father and the Son, very and eternal God. \nArticle VI\nOf the sufficiency of the Holy Scripture for Salvation\nHoly Scripture containeth all things necessary to salvation: so that whatsoever is not read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not to be required of any man, that it should be believed as an article of the faith, or be thought requisite or necessary to salvation. \nIn the name of Holy Scripture, we do understand those Canonical books of the Old and New testament, of whose authority was never any doubt in the Church.\nOf the names and number of the Canonical Books.\n\n\n\n\nGenesis.\nExodus.\nLeviticus.\nNumbers.\nDeuteronomy\nJoshua.\nJudges.\nRuth.\nThe First Book of Samuel.\nThe Second Book of Samuel.\nThe First Book of Kings.\nThe Second Book of Kings.\nThe First Book of Chronicles.\nThe Second Book of Chronicles.\nThe First Book of Esdras.\nThe Second Book of Esdras.\nThe Book of Esther.\nThe Book of Job.\nThe Psalms.\nThe Proverbs.\nEcclesiastes, or the Preacher.\nCantica, or Songs of Solomon.\nFour Prophets the Greater.\nTwelve Prophets the Less.\nAll the books of the New Testament, as they are commonly received, we do receive, and account them canonical.\n\n\nAnd the other books (as Hierome saith) the Church doth read for example of life and instruction of manners; but yet doth it not apply them to establish any doctrine. Such are these following:\n\n\nThe Third Book of Esdras.\nThe Fourth Book of Esdras.\nThe Book of Tobias.\nThe Book of Judith.\nThe rest of the Book of Esther.\nThe Book of Wisdom.\nJesus the Son of Sirach.\nBaruch the Prophet.\nThe Song of the Three Children.\nThe Story of Susanna.\nOf Bel and the Dragon.\nThe Prayer of Manasses.\nThe First Book of Maccabees.\nThe Second Book of Maccabees.\n\n\nArticle VII\nOf the Old Testament\nThe Old Testament is not contrary to the New; for both in the Old and New Testament everlasting life is offered to mankind by Christ, who is the only Mediator between God and man, being both God and man. Wherefore there are not to be heard which feign that the old fathers did look only for transitory promises. Although the law given from God by Moses, as touching ceremonies and rites, do not bind Christian men, nor the civil precepts thereof ought of necessity to be received in any commonwealth; yet, notwithstanding, no Christian man whatsoever is free from the obedience of the commandments which are called moral. \n\n\n\n\nArticle VIII\nOf the Three Creeds\nThe three Creeds, Nicene Creed, Athanasius' Creed, and that which is commonly called the Apostles' Creed, ought thoroughly to be received and believed; for they may be proved by most certain warrants of Holy Scripture.", "Articles IX to XVIII: Personal Religion\n\nArticle IX\nOf Original or Birth Sin\nOriginal sin standeth not in the following of Adam (as the Pelagians do vainly talk), but it is the fault and corruption of the nature of every man that naturally is engendered of the offspring of Adam, whereby man is very far gone from original righteousness, and is of his own nature inclined to evil, so that the flesh lusteth always contrary to the spirit; and therefore in every person born into this world, it deserveth God's wrath and damnation. And this infection of nature doth remain, yea, in them that are regenerated, whereby the lust of the flesh, called in Greek phronema sarkos (which some do expound the wisdom, some sensuality, some the affection, some the desire of the flesh), is not subject to the law of God. And although there is no condemnation for them that believe and are baptized, yet the Apostle doth confess that concupiscence and lust hath itself the nature of sin. \n\n\n\nArticle X\nOf Free Will\nThe condition of man after the fall of Adam is such, that he cannot turn and prepare himself, by his own natural strength and good works, to faith and calling upon God. Wherefore we have no power to do good works pleasant and acceptable to God, without the grace of God by Christ preventing us that we may have a good will, and working with us when we have that good will. \n\n\n\nArticle XI\nOf the Justification of Man\nWe are accounted righteous before God, only for the merit of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ by faith, and not for our own works or deservings. Wherefore that we are justified by faith only is a most wholesome doctrine, and very full of comfort; as more largely is expressed in the Homily of Justification. \n\n\nArticle XII\nOf Good Works\nAlbeit that good works, which are the fruits of faith and follow after justification, cannot put away our sins and endure the severity of God's judgement, yet are they pleasing and acceptable to God in Christ, and do spring out necessarily of a true and lively faith, insomuch that by them a lively faith may be as evidently known as a tree discerned by the fruit. \nArticle XIII\nOf Works before Justification\nWorks done before the grace of Christ and the inspiration of His Spirit, are not pleasant to God, forasmuch as they spring not of faith in Jesus Christ, neither do they make men meet to receive grace, or (as the School authors say) deserve grace of congruity: yea, rather for that they are not done as God hath willed and commanded them to be done, we doubt not but they have the nature of sin. \nArticle XIV\nOf Works of Supererogation\nVoluntary works besides, over and above, God's commandments which they call Works of Supererogation, cannot be taught without arrogancy and impiety. For by them men do declare that they do not only render unto God as much as they are bound to do, but that they do more for His sake than of bounden duty is required: Whereas Christ saith plainly, When ye have done all that are commanded to you, say, We be unprofitable servants. \nArticle XV\nOf Christ alone without Sin\nChrist in the truth of our nature was made like unto us in all things, sin only except, from which He was clearly void, both in His flesh and in His spirit. He came to be the lamb without spot, Who by sacrifice of Himself once made, should take away the sins of the world: and sin, as S. John saith, was not in Him. But all we the rest, although baptized and born again in Christ, yet offend in many things: and if we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. \nArticle XVI\nOf Sin after Baptism\nNot every deadly sin willingly committed after Baptism is sin against the Holy Ghost, and unpardonable. Wherefore the grant of repentance is not to be denied to such as fall into sin after Baptism. After we have received the Holy Ghost, we may depart from grace given and fall into sin, and by the grace of God we may arise again and amend our lives. And therefore they are to be condemned, which say, they can no more sin as long as they live here, or deny the place of forgiveness to such as truly repent. \nArticle XVII\nOf Predestination and Election\nPredestination to life is the everlasting purpose of God, whereby, before the foundations of the world were laid, He hath constantly decreed by His counsel secret to us, to deliver from curse and damnation those whom He hath chosen in Christ out of mankind, and to bring them by Christ to everlasting salvation as vessels made to honour. Wherefore they which be endued with so excellent a benefit of God be called according to God's purpose by His Spirit working in due season; they through grace obey the calling; they be justified freely; they be made sons of God by adoption; they be made like the image of His only-begotten Son Jesus Christ; they walk religiously in good works; and at length by God's mercy they attain to everlasting felicity. \nAs the godly consideration of Predestination and our Election in Christ is full of sweet, pleasant, and unspeakable comfort to godly persons and such as feel in themselves the working of the Spirit of Christ, mortifying the works of the flesh and their earthly members and drawing up their mind to high and heavenly things, as well because it doth greatly establish and confirm their faith of eternal salvation to be enjoyed through Christ, as because it doth fervently kindle their love towards God: so for curious and carnal persons, lacking the Spirit of Christ, to have continually before their eyes the sentence of God's Predestination is a most dangerous downfall, whereby the devil doth thrust them either into desperation or into wretchlessness of most unclean living no less perilous than desperation.\nFurthermore, we must receive God's promises in such wise as they be generally set forth in Holy Scripture; and in our doings that will of God is to be followed which we have expressly declared unto us in the word of God.\n\nArticle XVIII\nOf obtaining eternal salvation only by the name of Christ\nThey also are to be had accursed that presume to say that every man shall be saved by the law or sect which he professeth, so that he be diligent to frame his life according to that law and the light of nature. For Holy Scripture doth set out to us only the name of Jesus Christ, whereby men must be saved.", "Articles XIX to XXXI: Corporate Religion\nArticle XIX\nOf the Church\nThe visible Church of Christ is a congregation of faithful men, in the which the pure word of God is preached and the sacraments be duly ministered according to Christ's ordinance in all those things that of necessity are requisite to the same. As the Church of Jerusalem, Alexandria, and Antioch have erred: so also the Church of Rome hath erred, not only in their living and manner of ceremonies, but also in matters of faith. \nArticle XX\nOf the Authority of the Church\nThe Church hath power to decree rites or ceremonies and authority in controversies of faith; and yet it is not lawful for the Church to ordain anything contrary to God's word written, neither may it so expound one place of Scripture, that it be repugnant to another. Wherefore, although the Church be a witness and a keeper of Holy Writ: yet, as it ought not to decree anything against the same, so besides the same ought it not to enforce anything to be believed for necessity of salvation. \nArticle XXI\nOf the authority of General Councils\nGeneral Councils may not be gathered together without the commandment and will of princes. And when they be gathered together, forasmuch as they be an assembly of men, whereof all be not governed with the Spirit and word of God, they may err and sometime have erred, even in things pertaining to God. Wherefore things ordained by them as necessary to salvation have neither strength nor authority, unless it may be declared that they be taken out of Holy Scripture. \nArticle XXII\nOf Purgatory\nThe Romish doctrine concerning Pugatory, Pardons, worshipping and adoration as well of Images as of Relics, and also Invocation of Saint, is a fond thing vainly invented, and grounded upon no warranty of Scripture; but rather repugnant to the word of God. \nArticle XXIII\nOf Ministering in the Congregation\nIt is not lawful for any man to take upon him the office of public preaching or ministering the sacraments in the congregation, before he be lawfully called and sent to execute the same. And those we ought to judge lawfully called and sent, which be chosen and called to this work by men who have public authority given unto them in the congregation to call and send ministers into the Lord's vineyard. \nArticle XXIV\nOf speaking in the Congregation in such a tongue as the people understandeth\nIt is a thing plainly repugnant to the word of God and the custom of the primitive Church, to have public prayer in the Church, or to minister the sacraments in a tongue not understanded of the people. \nArticle XXV\nOf the Sacraments\nSacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of Christian men's profession, but rather they be certain sure witnesses and effectual signs of grace and God's good will towards us, by the which He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also strengthen and confirm, our faith in Him. \nThere are two Sacraments ordained of Christ our Lord in the Gospel, that is to say, Baptism and the Supper of the Lord.\nThose five, commonly called Sacraments, that is to say, Confirmation, Penance, Orders, Matrimony, and Extreme Unction, are not to be counted for Sacraments of the Gospel, being such as have grown partly of the corrupt following of the Apostles, partly are states of life allowed in the Scriptures; but yet have not the like nature of Sacraments with Baptism and the Lord's Supper, for that they have not any visible sign or ceremony ordained of God.\nThe Sacraments were not ordained of Christ to be gazed upon or to be carried about, but that we should duly use them. And in such only as worthily receive the same, have they a wholesome effect or operation: but they that receive them unworthily, purchase to themselves damnation, as S. Paul saith.\n\nArticle XXVI\nOf the unworthiness of the Ministers, which hinders not the effect of the Sacraments\nAlthough in the visible Church the evil be ever mingled with the good, and sometime the evil have chief authority in the ministration of the word and sacraments; yet forasmuch as they do not the same in their own name, but in Christ's, and do minister by His commission and authority, we may use their ministry both in hearing the word of God and in the receiving of the sacraments. Neither is the effect of Christ's ordinance taken away by their wickedness, nor the grace of God's gifts diminished from such as by faith and rightly do receive the sacraments ministered unto them, which be effectual because of Christ's institution and promise, although they be ministered by evil men. \nNevertheless it appertaineth to the discipline of the Church that inquiry be made of evil ministers, and that they be accused by those that have knowledge of their offences; and finally, being found guilty by just judgement, be deposed.\n\nArticle XXVII\nOf Baptism\nBaptism is not only a sign of profession and mark of difference whereby Christian men are discerned from other that be not christened, but is also a sign of regeneration or new birth, whereby, as by an instrument, they that receive baptism rightly are grafted into the Church; the promises of the forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God, by the Holy Ghost are visibly signed and sealed; faith is confirmed, and grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God. The baptism of young children is in any wise to be retained in the Church as most agreeable with the institution of Christ. \nArticle XXVIII\nOf the Lord's Supper\nThe Supper of the Lord is not only a sign of the love that Christians ought to have among themselves, one to another, but rather it is a sacrament of our redemption by Christ's death: insomuch that to such as rightly, worthily, and with faith receive the same, the bread which we break is a partaking of the body of Christ, and likewise the cup of blessing is a partaking of the blood of Christ. \nTransubstantiation (or the change of the substance of bread and wine) in the Supper of the Lord, cannot be proved by Holy Writ, but is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture, overthroweth the nature of a Sacrament, and hath given occasion to many superstitions.\nThe body of Christ is given, taken, and eaten in the Supper, only after an heavenly and spiritual manner. And the mean whereby the body of Christ is received and eaten in the Supper is faith\nThe Sacrament of the Lord's Supper was not by Christ's ordinance reserved, carried about, lifted up, or worshipped.\n\nArticle XXIX\nOf the wicked which do not eat the body of Christ, in the use of the Lord's Supper\nThe wicked and such as be void of a lively faith, although they do carnally and visibly press with their teeth (as S. Augustine saith) the sacrament of the body and blood of Christ, yet in no wise are they partakers of Christ, but rather to their condemnation do eat and drink the sign or sacrament of so great a thing. \nArticle XXX\nOf Both Kinds\nThe Cup of the Lord is not to be denied to the lay people; for both parts of the Lord's sacrament, by Christ's ordinance and commandment, ought to be ministered to all Christian men alike. \nArticle XXXI\nOf the one oblation of Christ finished upon the Cross\nThe offering of Christ once made is the perfect redemption, propitiation, and satisfaction for all the sins of the whole world, both original and actual, and there is none other satisfaction for sin but that alone. Wherefore the sacrifices of Masses, in the which it was commonly said that the priests did offer Christ for the quick and the dead to have remission of pain or guilt, were blasphemous fables and dangerous deceits.", "Articles XXXII to XXXIX: Miscellaneous\nArticle XXXII\nOf the Marriage of Priests\nBishops, Priests, and Deacons are not commanded by God's laws either to vow the estate of single life or to abstain from marriage. Therefore it is lawful also for them, as for all other Christian men, to marry at their own discretion, as they shall judge the same to serve better to godliness. \nArticle XXXIII\nOf Excommunicated Persons, how they are to be avoided\nThat persons which by open denunciation of the Church is rightly cut off from the unity of the Church and excommunicated, ought to be taken of the whole multitude of the faithful as an heathen and publican, until he be openly reconciled by penance and received into the Church by a judge that hath authority thereto. \nArticle XXXIV\nOf the Traditions of the Church\nIt is not necessary that traditions and ceremonies be in all places one or utterly alike; for at all times they have been diverse, and may be changed according to the diversity of countries, times, and men's manners, so that nothing be ordained against God's word. \nWhosoever through his private judgement willingly and purposely doth openly break the traditions and ceremonies of the Church which be not repugnant to the word of God, and be ordained and approved by common authority, ought to be rebuked openly that other may fear to do the like, as he that offendeth against common order of the Church, and hurteth the authority of the magistrate, and woundeth the conscience of the weak brethren.\nEvery particular or national Church hath authority to ordain, change, and abolish ceremonies or rites of the Church ordained only by man's authority, so that all things be done to edifying.\n\n\nArticle XXXV\nOf Homilies\nThe second Book of Homilies, the several titles whereof we have joined under this Article, doth contain a godly and wholesome doctrine and necessary for these times, as doth the former Book of Homilies which were set forth in the time of Edward the Sixth: and therefore we judge them to be read in Churches by the ministers diligently and distinctly, that they may be understanded of the people. \n\n\nOf the Names of the Homilies\n\t1.\tOf the right Use of the Church\n\t2.\tAgainst peril of Idolatry\n\t3.\tOf the repairing and keeping clean of Churches\n\t4.\tOf good Works: first of Fasting\n\t5.\tAgainst Gluttony and Drunkenness\n\t6.\tAgainst Excess of Apparel\n\t7.\tOf Prayer\n\t8.\tOf the Place and Time of Prayer\n\t9.\tThat Common Prayers and Sacraments ought to be ministered in a known tongue.\n\t10.\tOf the reverend estimation of God's Word\n\t11.\tOf Alms-doing\n\t12.\tOf the Nativity of Christ\n\t13.\tOf the Passion of Christ\n\t14.\tOf the Resurrection of Christ\n\t15.\tOf the worthy receiving of the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ\n\t16.\tOf the Gifts of the Holy Ghost\n\t17.\tFor the Rogation-days\n\t18.\tOf the state of Matrimony\n\t19.\tOf Repentance\n\t20.\tAgainst Idleness\n\t21.\tAgainst Rebellion\n\n\nArticle XXXVI\nOf Consecration of Bishops and Ministers\nThe Book of Consecration of Archbishops and Bishops and ordering of Priests and Deacons, lately set forth in the time of Edward the Sixth and confirmed at the same time by authority of Parliament, doth contain all things necessary to such consecration and ordering; neither hath it anything that of itself is superstitious or ungodly. \nAnd therefore whosoever are consecrate or ordered according to the rites of that book, since the second year of King Edward unto this time, or hereafter shall be consecrated or ordered according to the same rites, we decree all such to be rightly, orderly, and lawfully consecrated or ordered.\n\n\nArticle XXXVII\nOf the Civil Magistrates\nThe Queen's Majesty hath the chief power in this realm of England and other her dominions, unto whom the chief government of all estates of this realm, whether they be ecclesiastical or civil, in all causes doth appertain, and is not nor ought to be subject to any foreign jurisdiction. \nWhere we attribute to the Queen's Majesty the chief government, by which titles we understand the minds of some slanderous folks to be offended, we give not to our princes the ministering either of God's word or of sacraments, the which thing the Injunctions also lately set forth by Elizabeth our Queen doth most plainly testify: but only that prerogative which we see to have been given always to all godly princes in Holy Scriptures by God himself, that is, that they should rule all estates and degrees committed to their charge by God, whether they be temporal, and restrain with the civil sword the stubborn and evil-doers.\nThe Bishop of Rome hath no jurisdiction in this realm of England.\nThe laws of the realm may punish Christian men with death for heinous and grievous offences.\nIt is lawful for Christian men at the commandment of the Magistrate to wear weapons and serve in the wars.\n\n\nArticle XXXVIII\nOf Christian men's good which are not common\nThe riches and goods of Christians are not common, as touching the right, title, and possession of the same, as certain Anabaptists do falsely boast; notwithstanding every man ought of such things as he possesseth liberally to give alms to the poor, according to his ability. \n\n\nArticle XXXIX\nOf a Christian man's Oath\nAs we confess that vain and rash swearing is forbidden Christian men by our Lord Jesus Christ, so we judge that Christian religion doth not prohibit but that a man may swear when the magistrate requireth in a cause of faith and charity, so it be done according to the Prophet's teaching in justice, judgement, and truth.\n\n\n \nAnd having attested to this God Help Me,\n \nIn vimto vas deferens glorium pax est dominus merkins\n \nAmen\n \n \n\n(signed)\n................\n\n\n(date)\n............\n\n\nWitness\n..........\n\n\naddress\n\n\n.............\n.............\n.............\n.............\n\n\nChurch / Elder Shamen details:\n\n\n..........\n.........\n........."], "messages": [{"from_name": "annaai.saacm@katamail.com", "to_name": "annaai.saacm@katamail.com", "date": "2010-07-19 02:54", "subject": "Hello", "author_role": "scam", "body": "how are you hope fine please write me back  i have some thing very important to tell you,Anna", "raw": "  <div id=\"record\">\n\t<div id=\"char\"><span class=\"ai\">Anna Isaac</span>\n\t</div>\n\t<div id=\"dialog\" class=\"st\">\n\t\n<p>\nTo: annaai.saacm@katamail.com<br />\nDate: Mon, 19 Jul 2010 02:54:26 +0200<br />\nSubject: Hello<br />\nFrom: annaai.saacm@katamail.com\n</p>\n\n how are you hope fine please write me back  i have some thing very important to tell you,Anna\n\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "<annaisaac.01@gmx.com>", "date": "2010-07-19 05:35", "subject": "RE: Hello", "author_role": "bait", "body": "Who is this?

I will really like to have a good relationship with you. I have a special reason why I decided to contact you. Though it is not left for me to say, but I know that I am an honest girl, trustworthy, truthful, loving kindness, open minded, easy going faithful and caring.\n\n\nI decided to contact you  because of the urgency of my situation here. My Name is Miss. Anna  Isaac Vaye, 24 years old and from Liberia , in the western part of Africa , My late Father -Isaac Nuhan Vaye, was the Deputy Minister of Public Works in Charles Taylor's government. He was falsely accused of plotting to remove the(PRESIDENT OF LIBERIA- CHARLES TAYLOR) from office. Without trial, Charles Taylor killed him.Though, I do not know to what extent you are familiar with events and fragile political situation in Liberia as at that time. But it formed consistent headlines in the CNN, BBC news bulletins. You can verify this from some of the international newspapers posted in the web sites below:\n\n\nhttp://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2003-07-15-liberia_x.htm\n\n\nInfact, I am constrained to contact you because of the maltreatment I am receiving from my step mother. My Father had two wives before his demise. My mother was the second; the first one couldn't raise him an issue after nine years of their marriage that emerged in him the idea of getting a second wife that happened to be my late mother. After the marriage of my mother, the first wife turned hostile and aggressive till the extent that my father had to sent her packing and rented an apartment for her in the town. She came back with her things after the news of my parents' death. She has been more or less hostile to me and want to deny me of all my father's assets. I am just like being in a wickedcircle that nothing in the house pleases me.\n\n\nMeanwhile, I wanted to escape to the Europe but she hide away my international passport and other valuable travelling documents. Luckily she did not discover where I kept my father's File which contains important documents. So I decided to run to the refugee camp where I am presently seeking asylum under the United Nations High Commission for the Refugee here in Dakar , Republic of Senegal . Due to my inability and lack of resources, I decided to contact you for a help please, I will be very glad if you should consider to help me please. I am contacting you for a long term business relationship and investment assistance in your Country.\n\n\nMy father of blessed memory deposited the sum of US$10, 700, 000.00 in a Bank here in Senegal with my name as the next of kin. When I came to Senegal , I went to the bank where my father deposited the money so that I can withdraw some money as the next of kin to the account and start a new life. Unfortunately, I did not know that my father signed an agreement with the bank that the money should not be released directly to me if not married or up to 30years. The agreement states that I should appoint a trustee/investor any time I want to take the money from the bank before I am 30 years. I understand that the investor is to invest and manage the money for me in a good business.\n\n\nSo the bank people advised me that since I am not yet 30 years and not married, I should look for someone to stand for me for claims in accordance with their agreement with my late father. This is why I contacted you. Secondly, I like your country and I want to live there and continue my education as i was in my 1st year in the university, when the crisis started and death of my parents. It is my intention to compensate you with 20% of the total money for your services and the balance shall be our investment capital. This is the reason why I decided to contact you. Please all communications should be through this email address only for confidential purposes. As soon as I receive your positive response showing your interest I will put things into action immediately. In the light of the above, I shall appreciate an urgent message indicating your ability and willingness to handle this transaction sincerely.\n\n\nYou can not call me on phone because I have no phone here but if you will like to speak to me on phone I will give you phone number of the Reverend Father here in the camp beacuse I told him a little bit about my condition. When you call, tell him you want to speak to Anna Isaac Vaye, the liberian girl He will call me because he knows that I am staying in the female Hostel Room 74.\n\n\nAwaiting your urgent and positive response. Please do keep this only to yourself. Please I beg you not to disclose these  details till I come over, once the fund has been transferred.in to you account in your country then you will send some amount for me to prepar my traveling document to meet you over there in you country so that i can finish my education, then you use the money in to a  good business ok!\n\n\nAnna Isaac", "raw": "  <div id=\"record\">\n\t<div id=\"char\"><span class=\"ai\">Anna Isaac</span>\n\t\n\t</div>\n\t<div id=\"dialog\" class=\"st\">\n\n\n\n<p>\nFrom: annaisaac.01@gmx.com<br />\nDate: Tue, 20 Jul 2010 02:39:35 +0200<br />\nSubject: thanks<br />\nTo: Lonslo Tossov\n</p>\n\n\n<p>\nDear Friend.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThanks for the opportunity to be your friend.

You can verify this from some of the international newspapers posted in the web sites below:\n</p>\n\n\n<p>\nhttp://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2003-07-15-liberia_x.htm\n</p>\n\n<p>\nInfact, I am constrained to contact you because of the maltreatment I am receiving from my step mother. My Father had two wives before his demise. My mother was the second; the first one couldn't raise him an issue after nine years of their marriage that emerged in him the idea of getting a second wife that happened to be my late mother. After the marriage of my mother, the first wife turned hostile and aggressive till the extent that my father had to sent her packing and rented an apartment for her in the town. She came back with her things after the news of my parents' death. She has been more or less hostile to me and want to deny me of all my father's assets. I am just like being in a wickedcircle that nothing in the house pleases me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMeanwhile, I wanted to escape to the Europe but she hide away my international passport and other valuable travelling documents. Luckily she did not discover where I kept my father's File which contains important documents. So I decided to run to the refugee camp where I am presently seeking asylum under the United Nations High Commission for the Refugee here in Dakar , Republic of Senegal . Due to my inability and lack of resources, I decided to contact you for a help please, I will be very glad if you should consider to help me please. I am contacting you for a long term business relationship and investment assistance in your Country.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMy father of blessed memory deposited the sum of US$10, 700, 000.00 in a Bank here in Senegal with my name as the next of kin. When I came to Senegal , I went to the bank where my father deposited the money so that I can withdraw some money as the next of kin to the account and start a new life. Unfortunately, I did not know that my father signed an agreement with the bank that the money should not be released directly to me if not married or up to 30years. The agreement states that I should appoint a trustee/investor any time I want to take the money from the bank before I am 30 years. I understand that the investor is to invest and manage the money for me in a good business.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSo the bank people advised me that since I am not yet 30 years and not married, I should look for someone to stand for me for claims in accordance with their agreement with my late father. This is why I contacted you. Secondly, I like your country and I want to live there and continue my education as i was in my 1st year in the university, when the crisis started and death of my parents. It is my intention to compensate you with 20% of the total money for your services and the balance shall be our investment capital. This is the reason why I decided to contact you. Please all communications should be through this email address only for confidential purposes. As soon as I receive your positive response showing your interest I will put things into action immediately. In the light of the above, I shall appreciate an urgent message indicating your ability and willingness to handle this transaction sincerely.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nYou can not call me on phone because I have no phone here but if you will like to speak to me on phone I will give you phone number of the Reverend Father here in the camp beacuse I told him a little bit about my condition. When you call, tell him you want to speak to Anna Isaac Vaye, the liberian girl He will call me because he knows that I am staying in the female Hostel Room 74.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAwaiting your urgent and positive response. Please do keep this only to yourself. Please I beg you not to disclose these  details till I come over, once the fund has been transferred.in to you account in your country then you will send some amount for me to prepar my traveling document to meet you over there in you country so that i can finish my education, then you use the money in to a  good business ok!\n</p>\n\nAnna Isaac\n\n\n\n<div id=\"aside3\">\n<p class=\"comment\">[Scam-o-note: so, the orphan's inheritance format.]</p>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "2010-07-20 05:19", "subject": "", "author_role": "bait", "body": "Dear Ms Isaac\n\n\nI must admit I am a bit flabbergasted by this story, although obviously greatly moved by your plight and I will certainly do what I can to see you get exactly what you deserve.
