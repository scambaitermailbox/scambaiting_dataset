Wow. Just WOW !!!! You Brits really do have a weird way of\ndoing business don't you?\n\n\n Let's recap. Did I ever call you crazy or a lunatic ? Of course not. I\nonly said I couldn't work with crazy people or lunatics. It's a simple\nstatement of fact, I won't do it. I did ask if you were ill or insane,\nbecause YOU YOURSELF said you were so stressed at work you were seeking\nmedical help ! Remember ? That was YOU said that, not me.\n\n\n I'm going to have to be firm about this. I want a doctor's statement\nconfirming that you are healthy enough to carry out this transaction. If\nyou're not, I can't work with you, and if you're so stressed I don't want\nour business relationship to drive you to a nervous breakdown.\n\n\n Remember, you and I have never met, so I still don't really know if I can\ntrust you, and to be honest, you're probably not 100% sure if you can trust\nme. So we HAVE to try and establish a good working relationship based on\nmutual trust and understanding.\n\n\nTalking about the Google thing is a perfect example. I asked you how far it\nwas from Nottingham to London because it's important - I may visit\nNottingham soon, and you're in London, so I want to know how easy it would\nbe for us to meet up. Don't you get that ? If you don't know how far it is\nfrom Nottingham to London, just so say so. Don't make a STUPID STUPID guess\nof 3,000 miles ! That just makes people think you are an IDIOT, which I'm\nsure a man in your position is NOT. And don't tell me it's time to forget\nabout this, it's REAL IMPORTANT !!! You STILL haven't told me what would be\na good place to meet up. So where ? London ? Nottingham ? Some other place\n? WHERE ?!?!?!?!?! And don't tell me \"you can't tell me that you know all\nthe distance linking one state or the other, even cities\" whatever that\nmeans. I DON'T know the distance between these places, that's the whole\nPOINT you NUMBSKULL !!!! That's why I asked YOU what the distance was,\nprecisely because I didn't know. And then you gave me a STUPID STUPID\nanswer ! What does that tell me about your intelligence ? Your approach to\nbusiness ?

Wow. Just WOW !!!! You Brits really do have a weird way of\ndoing business don't you?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Let's recap. Did I ever call you crazy or a lunatic ? Of course not. I\nonly said I couldn't work with crazy people or lunatics. It's a simple\nstatement of fact, I won't do it. I did ask if you were ill or insane,\nbecause YOU YOURSELF said you were so stressed at work you were seeking\nmedical help ! Remember ? That was YOU said that, not me.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n I'm going to have to be firm about this. <u>I want a doctor's statement</u>\nconfirming that you are healthy enough to carry out this transaction. If\nyou're not, I can't work with you, and if you're so stressed I don't want\nour business relationship to drive you to a nervous breakdown.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Remember, you and I have never met, so I still don't really know if I can\ntrust you, and to be honest, you're probably not 100% sure if you can trust\nme. So we HAVE to try and establish a good working relationship based on\nmutual trust and understanding.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTalking about the Google thing is a perfect example. I asked you how far it\nwas from Nottingham to London because it's important - I may visit\nNottingham soon, and you're in London, so I want to know how easy it would\nbe for us to meet up. Don't you get that ? If you don't know how far it is\nfrom Nottingham to London, just so say so. Don't make a STUPID STUPID guess\nof 3,000 miles ! That just makes people think you are an IDIOT, which I'm\nsure a man in your position is NOT. And don't tell me it's time to forget\nabout this, it's REAL IMPORTANT !!! You STILL haven't told me what would be\na good place to meet up. So where ? London ? Nottingham ? Some other place\n? WHERE ?!?!?!?!?! And don't tell me \"you can't tell me that you know all\nthe distance linking one state or the other, even cities\" whatever that\nmeans.

I thought we had gotten past all that crazy talk from you but nope,\nyour last message tells me you're heading back to wacko wacko land when it\ncomes to common sense and business competence.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n How dare you suggest I am \"playing prank\" with you, whatever that means !\nDon't you remember ? It was YOU who made stupid jokes to ME earlier in our\ncorrespondence. Believe me my friend, I have no time for pranks. Don't you\nremember how I told you the journey to my nearest Western Union is more\nthan 100 miles, much of it not even on roads ? I have made that journey for\nyou THREE (3) TIMES now. What have you done for me in exchange ? Nothing as\nfar as I can tell. Don't worry, I'm confident that you will come good in\nthe end. But that's the point isn't it ? International transactions like\nthis require a little bit of TRUST, and that's something you're not going\nto build by making STUPID STUPID accusations of pranks.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n And don't blame me if you sent me details of a bank account that wouldn't\naccept international transfers. That's YOUR FAULT, not mine pal.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n I really don't know what the rest of your message means, you talk in such\na strange way. Is that how English lawyers talk ? Anyway I can't respond to\nthe rest of your message cos I have no idea what you mean pal.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Now listen and listen good.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n It aint my fault if I aint familiar with the rules of Western Union. Just\nre-write the letter you sent with the correct words, and I'll make that\ntrip again, A FOURTH (4TH) TIME !!!\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Also, if you look back at the messages we have exchanged, you may remember\nI told you that I had to have answers to all questions that I asked. There\nwere several questions in my last e-mail to you that you have ignored.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnswer them all please.\n</p>\n\n\n\n <p>Kindest regards<br />\nNigel Ryan-Schama</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "", "author_role": "scam", "body": "August 21st\n\n\nAttention Nigel Ryan-Schama,\n\n\nPlease confirm the attachment below, a copy of Letter of Guarantee\nrequested. i will be waiting for a positive respond from you.\n\nRegards,\nDonald", "raw": "  <div id=\"record\">\n\t<div id=\"char\"><span class=\"dd\">Barrister Donald Dickson</span>\n\t</div>\n\t<div id=\"dialog\" class=\"st\">\n\n<p>\nAugust 21st\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAttention Nigel Ryan-Schama,\n</p>\n\n<p>\nPlease confirm the attachment below, a copy of Letter of Guarantee\nrequested. i will be waiting for a positive respond from you.\n</p>\n<p>Regards,<br />\nDonald</p>\n\n\n<p><img src=\"images/nrs-dickson-guarantee2.jpg\" border=1></p>\n\n\n\n</div>\n</div>\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "", "author_role": "scam", "body": "August 23rd\n\n\nAttention Nigel Ryan-Schama,\n\n\nHow are you my good friend, hope you did received my second letter as\nrequested?
