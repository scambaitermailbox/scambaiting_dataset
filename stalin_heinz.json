Which brings up an interesting\nquestion - how did you locate me? Before I go to all the trouble of\nobtaining a passport just to prove to you who I am, I would like to see\nsome evidence that these funds actually exist. You would be able to\nprovide such documentation, would you not?<br><br>\n\nSecondly, your last email mentioned the amount of money you would be\nspending on 'my' behalf for 'gratifications'. Correct me if I'm wrong,\nbut the money is actually being spent on 'our' behalf, da? And can you\nexplain what is actually meant by 'gratifications'? This could be\nanything from bribes to paying for hand-jobs. Please elaborate.<br><br>\n\nI also asked you previously (twice) what the term 'modality' means,\nwhich you never explained.<br><br>\n\nYou will please pardon my inquisitiveness. Call me silly, but as a\nformer member of the government here, I have always strived (strove?\nstriven? Pardon me, but, again,  English is not my native language) for\ntrue Soviet efficiency and accuracy.<br><br>\n\nI anxiously await to hear from you again.<br><br>\n\nHui Tebya,<br>\nJ.V.
