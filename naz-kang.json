As you know, my father-in-law, Raymondo Nazzariani, lies dying in a Hospice facility, and my beloved wife insists that we should be available at a moment's notice to come to his bed-side. When the man finally takes his last labored breath, and all the funeral arrangements are made, I will be able to attend this matter with the proper attention it deserves.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn the meantime, we can continue corresponding as business partners, tending to the details of the transaction, what is involved, etc.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBy the way, is your given name Gichun, or Kang? I would like to address you more familiarly, and I would prefer you address me by my given name, Richard.
