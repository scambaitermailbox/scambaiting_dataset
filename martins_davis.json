I said \n              I will send him money three different times at $5,000 each for a \n              certificate to certify that his money did not come from terrorism \n              or drugs. I have already sent him $3,000 USD. </p>\n            <p>I got the $15,000 today after I sold my car. I plan on sending \n              Mr. Okar the money in the next few days when the WU office is open. \n              Now you come to me with the exact same letter and I am very confused. \n              Please tell me what is going on. </p>\n            <p>Are you working with Prince Okar?

I will contact Mr. Okar by e-mail. <br>\n              I live in a mobile home and do not have a cell phone yet, but I \n              do have a computer here in the senior center of the mobile home \n              park with a private e-mail account. </p>\n            <p>Let me know what you think and I will ask Prince Okar what to do \n              next. The $15,000 is safe in a hiding place where no one will find \n              it, so the money is safe.
