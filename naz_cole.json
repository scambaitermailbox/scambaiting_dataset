I'm just glad that I don't have to rely on the telephone for my Internet connection, thanks to Deb, I have cable modem, and that doesn't require dial-up.

Thanks to our lucky stars, and good planning, we had plenty of food and water, and several dozen bottles of home-made elderberry and gooseberry wine, so that was a very civilized touch.

They're searching for lost merchant ships from the 1800's, thinking there will be a treasure aboard.
