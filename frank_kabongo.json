I just pretended that I had sent you the email by mistake \n              to see if your greed would make you do something stupid, and of \n              course it did! <br>\n              <br>\n              Let me answer a few questions that may be going around in your mind:<br>\n              <br>\n              1 - As you may have already guessed my name is not Willie Stroker.<br>\n              2 - There is no such company as Creature Heaven Butchers, the website \n              is fake.<br>\n              3 - I never did send anyone $3,270.<br>\n              4 - There is no person named Frank Kabongo. I was never sent a $200 \n              guarantee fee.<br>\n              5 - The emails you saw in my first email to you were all fake.<br>\n              6 - I KNOW you are a 419 scammer. Your original email proves it.<br>\n              <br>\n              You will be asking yourself why I did this to you &#147;Frank&#148;. \n              Well, I am sure at this point in time you are getting a very similar \n              feeling that your victims get when you STEAL money from them with \n              your pathetic little 419 scam. This is the feeling I want you to \n              remember when you next contact a real victim. Remember this feeling \n              very well &#147;Frank&#148;. What I am doing to you of course is \n              only a small version of what you and your fellow scammers do to \n              their victims. You should be thankful that all you lost was $200, \n              your victims and the victims of your fellow scammers lose MUCH more.<br>\n              <br>\n              Finally there is my business address, which you sent the $200 to. \n              Of course, as I already told you, there is no such business as Creature \n              Heaven Butchers, and it will not surprise you to learn that the \n              address you sent the cash to is not mine. I would not be foolish \n              enough to give you my real address would I?! In fact you sent the \n              $200 to a POST OFFICE 50 miles away from where I live!<br>\n              <br>\n              So, what happens now? Well, of course you could probably email me \n              back and make some threats, perhaps even a voodoo curse or something \n              like that?<br>\n              <br>\n              As for your money, well, thank you for sending it to me so quickly. \n              I am not interested in keeping it; I just wanted to teach you a \n              good lesson. I will probably donate it to a worthy cause. Perhaps \n              I will give to money to a 419 victim support group.<br>\n              <br>\n              Bye.</p>\n            <p>&nbsp;</p>\n            <p><b>I NEVER DID RECEIVE MY REPLY!</b></p>\n            <p>&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>Feeling sorry for Frank/Lucas? <b>DON'T</b>.
