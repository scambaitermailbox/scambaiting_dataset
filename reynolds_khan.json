On further investigation, I discovered that Mr. Al Nasser's family wife and two sons died during the Gulf War \nin Iraq and was the reason why he did not declare any next of kin or relation in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank and did not leave any WILL.

I have read the letter from the attorney and the requirements from the legal department of the Bank head quarters.  The documentations required by the bank can be arranged, so do not worry, because from the tone of your email, you sound depressed.  I want you to know that nothing good comes easy and that roads leading to success are always rough.\nFirst of all, you have to provide the attorney all the requirements he needed from you as stated in his email and also instruct him to get the Sworn Affidavit and Probate from the U. A. E Judiciary as he stated also in his letter, like item 4 and 5.  Item six is copy of the deposit certificate issued to Al Nasser when he deposited the funds in the bank.  I have sent you a copy of this document, so you have to send it to the attorney.  \nOn the WILL issue, I believe you know that there is no WILL for late Al Nasser, so this is how we shall handle that aspect.  This is what you shall tell the attorney. \nTell him that late Khalil Al Nasser left no will before his sudden death. That he was suppose to re-transfer the funds from U. A. E to your account in your country, as your company was about to relocate from U. A. E, but unfortunately he died unexpectedly, making it impossible for him to identify you as the beneficiary next of kin to the account. Tell him to explain to the bank legal department that you are the owner of the company and you do not require a written WILL by Khalil Al Nasser before you can claim your property and since there was no written WILL from Khalil Al Nasser stating you as the next of kin, you request him to make an alternative legal arrangements on your behalf in case where there is no WILL for such claim, because Khalil mentioned your name in the bank Form as his Next of Kin.  There is a particular legal document required to be used in such situation.   The legal document is called Letter of Administration where there is no WILL.  So this solves the problem of the WILL.  On the death certificate issue, I can handle that here.  I will get a Medical Director with the government hospital here in U. A. E to issue a death certificate for Al Nasser.   You have to inform the attorney that you have instructed your company's doctor in U. A. E to prepare a death certificate for Al Nasser, because of the circumstance surrounding the death of Al Nasser, no death certificate was issued for him.\nYour relationship with Khalil Al Nasser is business partner and late Khalil Al Nasser was in charge of U. A. E branch of the company.  This is what you shall tell the attorney.  You have to send him copy of your driver's license or your international passport for identification purpose. You have to also type and sign the power of attorney as he instructed.  I have read it and it is okay, it is just a power of attorney for him to be able to stand for you, so not witness is required as you thought.  On the issue of the company's Incorporation Certificate, that also can be handled, but will cost me some money likewise the death certificate.  I can get a copy of the Oracle Consulting Inc. Incorporation Certificate from the U. A. E Chamber of Commerce, I shall pay someone there to get a copy for me.  I want you to know that before I decide to embark on this transaction, I have thought of likely requirements by the bank and authorities, and slept over it and know that the transaction will not be a failure that was why I embarked.  So I need unreserved support from your end, in order to make\nthis a success.  I shall send you copies of the death and Incorporation Certificates as soon as I have them in my possession, so you forward them to the attorney.\nThe fees he requested for his legal consultation, payment of Sworn Affidavit, Probate and Stamp Duty fees.  They are acceptable, so you have to arrange to send that to him.  He requested through Western Union Money Transfer, I have to believe that he has his reasons for that payment system, but you can as well suggest to him any other means you feel better.  He also requested for 0.2% of the total inheritance funds for his charges, which will be paid to him after the inheritance funds has been released to you.  0.2% of let say, $24 million will amount to $48,000.  I think it is okay for his services, so you have to accept that as well. Please contact the attorney immediately with the above information and inform him that you are arranging the other documents to send to him soon.  I shall set off immediately to arrange for the two documents and I pray that I get them quick.  I will be\nupdating you on my progress.
