My residential address is as follows 320 First Street, NW Washington, District of Columbia 20534, United States, am thinking of moving since I am now wealthy. I am one of those that took part in the Compensation in Nigeria many years ago and they refused to pay me, I had paid over $42,000 while in the US, trying to get my payment all to no avail.\n\n\nSo I decided to travel down to Nigeria with all my compensation documents, And I was directed to meet Mr. Sam Coker, who is the member of Central Bank Of Nigeria and a Head of Transfer Department, and I contacted him and he explained everything to me. He said whoever is contacting us through emails are fake.\n\n\nHe took me to the Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria. Right now I am the most happiest woman on earth because I have received my compensation funds amounteing to $15,000,000.00 Moreover,Mr. Sam Coker, showed me the full information of those that are yet to receive their payments and I saw your email as one of the scam victims, that is why I decided to email you to stop dealing with those people, they are not with your fund, they are only making money out of you.
