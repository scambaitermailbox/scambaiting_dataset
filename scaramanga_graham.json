Then with this affidavit,a letter of administration will be applied for at the probate registry.\n \n3.Immediately the probate registry issues this letter of administration in your name, it will prove legally in the UK that  they have searched and there is no dispute in the administration of late Mr Eich's estate.With this letter of administration you have been legally recognised as the next of kin to late Mr Eich.\n \n4.With  this letter of administration which makes you the legal next of kin to the deceased,your claim will be filled for at the storage company for them to make you the beneficiary of the funds .They will have no option than to give you full authority to the funds since you have all the legal documents.\nFurther more , after a long negotiation the lawyer said that his fees will be 22,000 Pounds.After further negotiation i was able to convince him that we will pay him the fees at the end of the transaction and he agreed.\n \nHe also said that we will pay for the cost of the legal documents .That is all the government fees and  duties for the legal documents.He said he will let me know the exact cost by Monday.\n \nIn this transaction i want us to conclude as quick as possible as time is not our best friend .Please try to also expedite all actions from your side to avoid unnecessary delays.\n \nAs regards your investment ideas i believe that they are very lucrative but i want to also suggest that we should also buy some real estate and stocks with part of the funds.From my past experience ,It is usually better to spread  your investments in different areas .\n \nI will try to send you my picture as soon as possible.You are also free to visit UK for the transaction.\n \nAll that i have written in this mail  is the whole truth and the best legal procedure that will lead to our success in this lucrative transaction.\n \nI am waiting for your urgent reply.\n \nMany thanks in advance.\n \nTruly yours.\nCharles", "scamorama main street \n* \nget booked \n*"], "messages": [{"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "", "author_role": "scam", "body": "From:\t\"Charles Graham\" <charles_graham01@yahoo.co.uk>\nSubject:\tHello\nDate:\tThu, 26 Apr 2007 \nHello. \n  \nI feel very sorry to interrupt your peace since you are not expecting \nto receive any mail from me.

So please do not be embarrassed or suspicious. <br /><br />\n  \nThe details of my proposal are as follows. \nI work as a private  financial adviser in Birmingham . <br /><br />\n  \nSome years ago I was attending a business luncheon in Berlin, Germany where i met a German based business man ,Mr Christian Eich, we discussed about his intentions to invest in the United kingdom. Then some months later we met again in London, and I assisted him, to make a deposit of fifteen million five hundred thousand US dollars  [ 15.5million US  Dollars in a storage company in UK for onward investments after six months in 2002 .I had an agreement with him to set up an investment portfolio.I was his portfolio manager. <br /><br />\n  \n  Upon Maturity of the first six months, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address, to confirm if he  wanted to continue rolling it over another duration, but I got no response from  him. \n  <br /><br />\nAfter another six months, I sent another reminder to know if he wanted \n to continue rolling over the interest, but i still did not get any response \nfrom him. I had to make personal efforts to reach him, since i was his \nportfolio manager that personally guided him  to make this deposit and surprisingly I discovered that my client was aboard the Concorde Air France flight AF4590  which crashed, killing all passengers on board and including his wife Andrea and only two children. Please click here \nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm<br />\nAfter months of investigations, all attempts to trace any his relatives to him proved fruitless, as it was discovered that the depositor (Mr. Christain Eich) did not declare any next of kin or relations \nin all his official documents.<br />\nSince then, the money has been in the storage company and nobody has come to make claims and I believe 'NO ONE' will ever come forward to make claims, since the entire family was eventually wiped out. I have made efforts to locate a member of his family with strong biological links \nto my late client without success. <br /><br />\n  \nThe search to find a close relation is one that has consumed time and resources.\nMy proposal is to package and present you as next of kin to my deceased client and process the fixed deposit for transfer  to you for our mutual benefit. The transaction will be executed under normal legitimate arrangements. So that you and I can benefit from this 'FREE MONEY', since it now belongs to nobody. \n  <br /><br />\n Moreover, it is pertinent to note that it is not risky .<br />\nNOTE: I know there may be scams and junk mails flying here and there on \nthe internet but certainly, this is not one. Please do not fail to \nunderstand that in spite of all that, opportunities of this kind still \nabound. If you have ever wished or prayed for something good to come your way, now I urge you to take this message seriously and with an open \nmind. You could never know. This may be an answer to your prayers. So \nplease give it a benefit of doubt, and join me with trust. <br />\nI am assuring you very strongly that you will never be disappointed.<br />\nPlease reply urgently and furnish your TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS, for further details.<br />\nTreat as strictly confidential.<br />\nBest regards, <br />\nCharles Graham\n</span><br /><br />\n\n<span class=\"comment\">[A classic <a href=\"bankcustomer.html\" target=\"_blank\">Dead Bank Customer</a> letter.
