We have nearly\n300 churches in our ministry.\nI must say that you are working for a wonderful cause, and you\nare to be blessed for passing along the word of God.\nA little about our ministry: We are fundamental Christians and\nAnimalistic constortians. This means that we worship Almighty God\nas all Christians do, but we also hold certain animals in very high\nregards, as in the Indian faith, we regard the cow as the holiest\nof God's holy creatures, hence out church is named The Church of\nThe Holy Cow. Every member who joins our ministry has a cow branded\nwith their name, this shows their faith in our ministry and also\nsaves this wonderful creature from being slaughtered for food. The\nmember's cow becomes adopted into the church and is saved from stress\nand fear. All adopted cows are keep on our 200,000 acre ranch in\nFlorida.\nI think I may be able to help you. You see, my ministry regularly\nmakes charitable donations to worthy causes, and after speaking\nwith my committee members, we are of the opinion that your cause\nis indeed very worthy, and if you will allow us we would like to\nmake a donation to your cause to help you in seeing your dream of\na ministry become a reality. Hopefully you will also agree to forward\nthe word of God more easily.\nYour case seems very worthwhile, and whilst we cannot donate very\nlarge amounts because we have already made many successful donations\nthis year. The donation committee has agreed that we would be able\nto send you the small sum of US $274,330 (two hundred and seventy\nfour thousand, three hundred and thirty dollars).

This money would\nbe sent to you in a manner of your choosing, and hopefully it would\nenable you to forward the word of God much more easily.\nOf course, we do not send out payments without going through the\nproper procedures, so if you would like to claim the cash, these\nare the steps you will need to take:\n1. The Church of The Holy Cow will send you a agreement form, which\nyou will have to complete and sign.\n2.
