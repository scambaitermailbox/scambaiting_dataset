The deceased account holder with our bank was Mr. JOSEPH F. GRILLO American citizen who died in world trade center as a victim of the September 11,2001 Incident that befall the United State of America He held account number AB/0036101101 with our bank.ince his death ,his account has been dormant and nobody has applied to our bank for the release of this money to him or her as the next of kin.\n\nAs the bill and exchange manager of this bank, i have studied this transaction very carefully and i have noted that there is no risk involved.I am here to protect all your intrests in this transaction until this money hits your account.\n\nMy advise to you is to arrange for a receiving bank account into which our bank shall transfer this money in your favor as next of kin and you have nothing to fear since i am here ,i shall be giving you all the developmental information from the bank as soon as the transaction commence. Also note that 14 working days from the date the bank receives your application is enough for the funds to get transferred and the transaction will come to a successful conclusion.\n\nDear, i hope that you will not disappoint me when this money enters into your account, i have all my hope in this transaction because i shall soon go on retirement, i am a simple banker whose credibility is still intact and with my maturity and understanding,I promise to give the best co-operation. If you are really intertested in this transaction,then we must hurry up so that our bank and government shall not claim and inherit this money because it has over-stayed. \n\nAs soon as I hear from you, I will send to you a text of application which you will fill and send to the bank. But before that I will like to be reassured of the manner of person whom I am dealing with because 10.5million U.S.D is not a little money,therefore I have to get certain necessary facts about you before we proceed. Such information I will like to know before we proceed are as follows:\n(1) Your age.\n(2)Your occupation \n(3)Your marital stautus \n(4)Your fullresidential address.\n(5)Your direct phone and fax numbers.\n(6)A copy of Your photo scanned and sent to me by mail.\n\nas soon as I receive these datas, I will forward to you the application form which you will send to the bank. Meanwhile I will like you to know more about myself.\n\nI am a family man with 2 children a girl and a boy.I have decided to do this deal because i have worked in this bank for years without achieving anything due to the corruption in this country.Workers salaries are hardly paid.Its true this country is one of the poorest in the world but the leaders are very wicked and corrupt.Even the Aids we receive from Donor countries as well as the international communities are being diverted into the private pockets of the few in authourity. \n\nTherefore while the rich are getting richer,the poor masses continues to suffer.Could you beleive a bill and exchange manager like myself can't even take good care of my children?I only have a name NOT money or any material possessions.So this is why when i saw this opportunity, i decided to capitalize on it with my position in the bank and i hope with your co-operation,success will be for us.\nPls always keep in touch with me, preferably by phone because i'm a very busy man who has little or no time for internets.

The deceased account holder with our bank was Mr. JOSEPH F. GRILLO American citizen who died in world trade center as a victim of the September 11,2001 Incident that befall the United State of America He held account number AB/0036101101 with our bank.ince his death ,his account has been dormant and nobody has applied to our bank for the release of this money to him or her as the next of kin.\n<br /><br />\nAs the bill and exchange manager of this bank, i have studied this transaction very carefully and i have noted that there is no risk involved.I am here to protect all your intrests in this transaction until this money hits your account.<br /><br />\n\nMy advise to you is to arrange for a receiving bank account into which our bank shall transfer this money in your favor as next of kin and you have nothing to fear since i am here ,i shall be giving you all the developmental information from the bank as soon as the transaction commence. Also note that 14 working days from the date the bank receives your application is enough for the funds to get transferred and the transaction will come to a successful conclusion.\n<br /><br />\nDear, i hope that you will not disappoint me when this money enters into your account, i have all my hope in this transaction because i shall soon go on retirement, i am a simple banker whose credibility is still intact and with my maturity and understanding,I promise to give the best co-operation. If you are really intertested in this transaction,then we must hurry up so that our bank and government shall not claim and inherit this money because it has over-stayed. <br /><br />\n\nAs soon as I hear from you, I will send to you a text of application which you will fill and send to the bank. But before that I will like to be reassured of the manner of person whom I am dealing with because 10.5million U.S.D is not a little money,therefore I have to get certain necessary facts about you before we proceed. Such information I will like to know before we proceed are as follows:<br />\n(1) Your age.<br />\n(2)Your occupation <br />\n(3)Your marital stautus<br /> \n(4)Your fullresidential address.<br />\n(5)Your direct phone and fax numbers.<br />\n(6)A copy of Your photo scanned and sent to me by mail.\n<br /><br />\nas soon as I receive these datas, I will forward to you the application form which you will send to the bank.

Good Morning, SIR!!!<br /><br />\n\nThe Corporal has received the BIB Questionnaire (see attached, please, Sir) and has printed out the item, and will immediately fill it, and return it to the Sheriff as e-mail attachment. I will bcc to you, Sir.<br /><br />\n\nAs you can see, Sir, the thing is simplistic, and (if I may venture my opinion) just MORONIC.\n<br /><br />\n\"Did they have any children?\" \"If yes, were are they?\" Then the \"bank\" doesn't even ask for my signature! Auntie raynaz says this is because they have so much DBC-money, they can't throw it at you fast enough--at least, that's what they want you to think.\n<br /><br />\nSIR! The Corporal is wondering how long it will take before the reque$t for money come$. Auntie thinks it will be this afternoon, but I think tomorrow. Your thoughts on this, Sir?\n<br /><br />\nCpl. D.
