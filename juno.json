We certainly can use all the working capital we can\nprocure. However, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid we just today ran into an unexpected snag. It turns out the fish we\nhave been catching that we thought were Salmon, aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Salmon at all. Those fish were actually\naccidentally transplanted into the Great Lakes from Iceland. Apparently they got caught in the\nbilge of Icelandic Bjork ships, and inadvertently discharged into U.S. waters. The fish is actually\ncalled a \u00e2\u0080\u009cKrabbamein\u00e2\u0080\u009d fish, which, translated from Icelandic means \u00e2\u0080\u009cCancer Fish\u00e2\u0080\u009d. It is actually\nhighly radioactive. Looking back, I wish we hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t eaten so many.\nWe aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t discouraged, though.

I think we can market that\nsauce quite effectively, provided we have the funding.\nI would be more than happy to provide you with all my personal information so we can move\nforward quickly, however I still will need proof of your identity. I appreciate the picture you sent,\nbut unfortunately I cannot accept it.

We certainly can use all the working capital we can\nprocure. However, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid we just today ran into an unexpected snag. It turns out the fish we\nhave been catching that we thought were Salmon, aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Salmon at all. Those fish were actually\naccidentally transplanted into the Great Lakes from Iceland. Apparently they got caught in the\nbilge of Icelandic Bjork ships, and inadvertently discharged into U.S. waters. The fish is actually\ncalled a \u00e2\u0080\u009cKrabbamein\u00e2\u0080\u009d fish, which, translated from Icelandic means \u00e2\u0080\u009cCancer Fish\u00e2\u0080\u009d. It is actually\nhighly radioactive. Looking back, I wish we hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t eaten so many.\nWe aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t discouraged, though. We feel that the key was not the species of fish itself but the\npreparation\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.. more specifically, my partner Jeff\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sauce, (Mangoo). I think we can market that\nsauce quite effectively, provided we have the funding.\nI would be more than happy to provide you with all my personal information so we can move\nforward quickly, however I still will need proof of your identity.

What do you mean \"they don't know what's in the box?\" What box? You told me the fund was 7.5\n\tMillion.... is that correct? If so, can I just pay the transfer fees out of that after I receive the fund? Why can't I just go to\n\tthe bank in Ghana and withdraw 7,496,500.00 and leave them the $3500 for the transfer fee? Also, what is the $1275.00\n\tyou are talking about now? Is that in addition to the $3500? I'm getting pretty confused here and I hope you can explain\n\tit to me.\n\tAnd by the way...... I did little research and there ARE poisonous snakes in Ghana! What about a Puff Adder?!!!! Ever\n\thear of that bad boy? I've attached a picture of a guys leg....... THAT is what happens when you get bit by a Puff\n\tAdder!!! Plus, I think there are black Mambas there, too.... I heard that Mambas are so fast, they can chase down men on\n\thorseback, leap into the air and bite them! Is that true? I guess those snakes really have a bad attitude!\n\tAlso, you never answered me about the food there. As I mentioned, I have an allergic reaction to shellfish as well as\n\tFructose sensitivity. (also, the roof of my mouth swells up from Carraway seeds, but it isn't too big a deal) Hopefully this\n\twon't be a problem.\n\tHoping to read from you..\n\tSalutatious Expeditious Intergallactic Regards\n\tJames T. Kirk\n\nPlease resend the response, I need to know the next step. I'm ready to book my ticket to Ghana.\nJames T.
