Tomorrow morning I should get details of my \nnew bank account, then I'll send your form to the bank.\n\nWell, my daughter and her family have been over for the weekend and her husband \ntook a photo of me. He's compressed it for the internet and I've attached it, so \nhope you get it OK.\n\nTheir visit leads to me asking a favor from you. They come from New Jersey and \ntheir oldest, Stacey, is at the Joseph Pillock College which is celebrating its \nbicentenery next year. If I can quote from the handout she left me: \"It was in \n1804 that the wealthy wool merchant and philanthropist, Joseph Pillock, founded \nthe school which grew to be today's well respected college. It was the wish of \nJoseph that the school he founded should, as well as providing a first rate \neducation, promote a strong interest in the world of which the United States is \nbut a part. The college is proud to still be honoring Joseph's wish 200 years \nlater and to mark this, we aim to gather photographs and messages of goodwill \nfrom as many countries as we can.\" I mentioned to Stacey that I was in email \ncontact with someone from Nigeria (don't worry - I said that you were hoping to \nbook a few days' whale-watching on board my boat) and she said it would be \nreally cool if you could send a photo of you in Nigeria, perhaps in the street \nor at a market, holding a sign saying 'I'm for Pillock College'.

Tomorrow morning I should get details of my \nnew bank account, then I'll send your form to the bank.<br>\n<br>\nWell, my daughter and her family have been over for the weekend and her husband \ntook a photo of me. He's compressed it for the internet and I've attached it, so \nhope you get it OK.<br>\n<br>\nTheir visit leads to me asking a favor from you. They come from New Jersey and \ntheir oldest, Stacey, is at the Joseph Pillock College which is celebrating its \nbicentenery next year. If I can quote from the handout she left me: \"It was in \n1804 that the wealthy wool merchant and philanthropist, Joseph Pillock, founded \nthe school which grew to be today's well respected college. It was the wish of \nJoseph that the school he founded should, as well as providing a first rate \neducation, promote a strong interest in the world of which the United States is \nbut a part. The college is proud to still be honoring Joseph's wish 200 years \nlater and to mark this, we aim to gather photographs and messages of goodwill \nfrom as many countries as we can.\" I mentioned to Stacey that I was in email \ncontact with someone from Nigeria (don't worry - I said that you were hoping to \nbook a few days' whale-watching on board my boat) and she said it would be \nreally cool if you could send a photo of you in Nigeria, perhaps in the street \nor at a market, holding a sign saying 'I'm for Pillock College'. I said I was \nsure you'd be able to do that for her - she is so excited. If you email the \nphoto to me, I'll send it straight on to her. Many thanks.<br>\n<br>\nI'll look forward to hearing from you, and I'll let you know as soon as I send \nthe bank their form.<br>\n<br>\nwith best wishes,<br>\n<br>\nHal<br>\n<br>\n",

      "body": "Date:Sat, 8 Nov 2003 13:31:31 -0800 (PST)\nFrom:\"Harold Munster\" \nSubject:UPS?\n\nHi Phil\n\nYou would be proud of me - I've made a lot of progress on this transfer.\n\nI spoke to Mrs Kirkpatrick at Kings Market, our island general store. She had \nheard of Western Union and said that sometimes tourists ask for it to get money \nsent from home. 'You learn something new every day,' I told her. But she said \nthere is no Western Union on San Juan - the nearest is Anacortez which is a \nferry ride away and she had a feeling that only opened in the tourist season. \nOtherwise it would be the mainland - probably Seattle. At this my heart sank - \nhad my boat been in the water I could perhaps have made the trip but there is no \nway I could take a ferry and be off the island all day without Pam wanting to \nknow why. And I can't risk raising her suspicions if I've borrowed $7,000 of the \nchurch's money!\n\nBut then she said that what people had done was to use the UPS 'BondLink' \nservice. I wandered down to the UPS agent and picked up a leaflet for this \nservice, and having asked quite a few questions believe I understand it. It \nseems to work like this:\n\n- It is designed for financial instruments such as bearer securities (whatever \nthey are!) but he says people do use it for cash. It is ultra secure in that \ndetails of the consignment are kept secret and if anything does not match up, it \nis returned to sender.\n\n- To use it, I need to get your full name (or that of the person collecting the \nconsignment) and the country of issue and number of some form of photo ID (they \nrecommend your passport). I then take the package and send it to a UPS agent in \nNigeria, quoting your name and ID. The package does not get a conventional \ntracking number as the only person who can track it is me, by email progress \nreports or through the agent here in Friday Harbor.\n\n- You go to the agent in Nigeria, show them your ID and provide the password I \nwill give you. If there is a match, they will give you the package. If the \ndetails do not match, they will not even admit that there is a package for you \n(although they will tell me there has been an unsuccessful attempt to collect \nthe package). If after 4 days the package has not been collected, it will be \nsent back to me.\n\nThis service (as you might expect) isn't cheap but seems like the only way I can \nget round the lack of Western Union on the island. Presumably you are happy for \nme to add the cost to my expenses when we divide up the \u00a312.5 million?\n\nIf you are happy with this, can you let me have the name, ID type and number for \nthe person who will be collecting the package. Can you also tell me which of \nthese UPS agents is most convenient for you:\n\n17 Olaide Tomori Street\nOff Simbat Abiola Way\nIkeja\nLagos\n\nHallmark Bank Building\n139 Broad Street\nLagos\n\nEleganza Plaza\n1, Commercial Road\nApapa\nLagos\n\n12 Idowu Taylor Street\nVictoria Island\nLagos\n\nI get up to 15KG for the basic fee - I know you will be coming over soon but are \nthere any little gifts (perhaps for friends you are leaving behind) that you \nwould like me to put in? We can get most things on the island, and I will not be \nable to get a UPS pickup until Tuesday at the earliest. Once it is on its way, I \nwill tell you the arrival date and password.\n\nI know that there is a lot of information and if anything is unclear please tell \nme.

      "raw": "<hr><b><font color=\"#0000ff\">Hal Munster III</font></b><br>\n<br>\n<i>Can I set up Adama for a wild goose chase to UPS branches around Nigeria?</i></p>\n<p>Date:Sat, 8 Nov 2003 13:31:31 -0800 (PST)<br>\nFrom:\"Harold Munster\" <br>\nSubject:UPS?<br>\nTo: \"philip adama\" &lt;adamaphilip@yahoo.com&gt;<br>\n<br>\nHi Phil<br>\n<br>\nYou would be proud of me - I've made a lot of progress on this transfer.<br>\n<br>\nI spoke to Mrs Kirkpatrick at Kings Market, our island general store. She had \nheard of Western Union and said that sometimes tourists ask for it to get money \nsent from home. 'You learn something new every day,' I told her. But she said \nthere is no Western Union on San Juan - the nearest is Anacortez which is a \nferry ride away and she had a feeling that only opened in the tourist season. \nOtherwise it would be the mainland - probably Seattle. At this my heart sank - \nhad my boat been in the water I could perhaps have made the trip but there is no \nway I could take a ferry and be off the island all day without Pam wanting to \nknow why. And I can't risk raising her suspicions if I've borrowed $7,000 of the \nchurch's money!<br>\n<br>\nBut then she said that what people had done was to use the UPS 'BondLink' \nservice. I wandered down to the UPS agent and picked up a leaflet for this \nservice, and having asked quite a few questions believe I understand it. It \nseems to work like this:<br>\n<br>\n- It is designed for financial instruments such as bearer securities (whatever \nthey are!) but he says people do use it for cash. It is ultra secure in that \ndetails of the consignment are kept secret and if anything does not match up, it \nis returned to sender.<br>\n<br>\n- To use it, I need to get your full name (or that of the person collecting the \nconsignment) and the country of issue and number of some form of photo ID (they \nrecommend your passport). I then take the package and send it to a UPS agent in \nNigeria, quoting your name and ID. The package does not get a conventional \ntracking number as the only person who can track it is me, by email progress \nreports or through the agent here in Friday Harbor.<br>\n<br>\n- You go to the agent in Nigeria, show them your ID and provide the password I \nwill give you. If there is a match, they will give you the package. If the \ndetails do not match, they will not even admit that there is a package for you \n(although they will tell me there has been an unsuccessful attempt to collect \nthe package). If after 4 days the package has not been collected, it will be \nsent back to me.<br>\n<br>\nThis service (as you might expect) isn't cheap but seems like the only way I can \nget round the lack of Western Union on the island. Presumably you are happy for \nme to add the cost to my expenses when we divide up the \u00a312.5 million?<br>\n<br>\nIf you are happy with this, can you let me have the name, ID type and number for \nthe person who will be collecting the package. Can you also tell me which of \nthese UPS agents is most convenient for you:<br>\n<br>\n17 Olaide Tomori Street<br>\nOff Simbat Abiola Way<br>\nIkeja<br>\nLagos<br>\n<br>\nHallmark Bank Building<br>\n139 Broad Street<br>\nLagos<br>\n<br>\nEleganza Plaza<br>\n1, Commercial Road<br>\nApapa<br>\nLagos<br>\n<br>\n12 Idowu Taylor Street<br>\nVictoria Island<br>\nLagos<br>\n<br>\nI get up to 15KG for the basic fee - I know you will be coming over soon but are \nthere any little gifts (perhaps for friends you are leaving behind) that you \nwould like me to put in? We can get most things on the island, and I will not be \nable to get a UPS pickup until Tuesday at the earliest. Once it is on its way, I \nwill tell you the arrival date and password.<br>\n<br>\nI know that there is a lot of information and if anything is unclear please tell \nme. Otherwise, please let me know if you want me to go ahead and send the $7,000 \nby UPS (and what else I should send).<br>\n<br>\nI can just imagine the look on Pam's face when I tell her we are rich beyond our \ndreams - thanks for making this possible.

They suggested I ask if you could get to Cotonou \n- if I send the money tomorrow you could pick it up on Friday.

Well I'm sorry to have to tell you that wasn't quite the truth. For about \n18 months I've been seeing Mrs Babbister who works at the town council office \nwhich deals with boat licensing. It's not been too serious - we get together \nmaybe once, twice a month. But because she issues licenses for trip boats like \nmine, there could be a lot of ill feeling with my competitors if word got out.\n\nAnyway, a week last Saturday Brenda and I set out for Kanaka Bay on the other \nside of the island. We had anchored and were enjoying ourselves when Bruce \nRichards, another trip boat captain, saw my boat and came alongside. In the heat \nof the moment we never noticed til he was in my cockpit. I scrambled up to see \nhim and so did Brenda once she was decent - nothing was said but it wouldn't \ntake a rocket scientist to work out what was going on.\n\nWe both hoped that Bruce would be discreet and so it seemed until yesterday, \nwhen Pam came storming back from town demanding to know what I had been doing on \nmy boat with 'that woman'. I have never known her so angry. I'm afraid that in \nmy panic I made up the best story I could in it included you! Remember that when \nPatsy and Michael were here for the weekend (with Stacey) I mentioned that I had \nbeen in touch with you - I was keeping our business secret so I told them you \nworked for the Nigerian government and were investigating whether there could be \na whale watching industry in Nigeria. Well I told Pam that you had visited San \nJuan at the invitation of the county boat licensing office to see how we did \nthings here and Mrs Babbister had invited you to spend a day on my boat \n(naturally she would accompany you). I said to Pam that once we had left Friday \nHarbor you had been overcome with sea-sickness and Mrs Babbister had taken you \nbelow to lie down while I looked for somewhere to anchor. Her delay in coming up \nto see Bruce and her flustered state was because she had been settling you onto \none of the bunks and cleaning up from one particularly widespread vomiting. You \nhad remained below decks because you would not want to be introduced to a \nstranger in your fragile state.\n\nI could tell that Pam was suspicious, but she did seem to be taking in what I \nsaid. Then when I had finished she asked if that was all I had to say. When it \nwas, she thought for a while then said 'This guy Philip, the Nigerian, you're in \ntouch with him by email?' I said I was, so she said 'OK, get him to email me and \ntell me in his own words what happened.' I was momentarily speechless, but then \nsaid the only thing I could, which was 'yes'. So, my friend, I need one huge \nfavour from you please.\n\nCan you email Pam (pamela_munster@yahoo.co.uk) and basically tell her the story \nI gave her, but in your own words. Perhaps you can flesh it out a bit, \nexplaining how Nigeria has a coastline and whales and your government thinks \nthat the tourism opportunities are huge. You could explain how you flew to \nSeattle via Miami, and travelled to San Juan by ferry. Say that you spent a \ncouple of nights in Mrs Miggins' guesthouse and how you enjoyed the island \nalthough the cold was not to your liking, and that you were sorry you didn't \nhave time to visit our home but after the unfortunate incident on the boat you \nneeded to rest. Finally, perhaps you could say how enthusiastic you now are \nabout introducing whale watching in Nigeria. If you could do this for me, I will \nbe eternally grateful.\n\nI received your email about putting the money in a video. Right now I daren't \nmove and certainly daren't touch Pam's money but with your help it will all blow \nover and as soon as it does I'll do exactly as you say.\n\nThank you for helping me in my time of need - I'll not forget it.\n\nCheers, my friend,\n\nHal",

Remember that when \nPatsy and Michael were here for the weekend (with Stacey) I mentioned that I had \nbeen in touch with you - I was keeping our business secret so I told them you \nworked for the Nigerian government and were investigating whether there could be \na whale watching industry in Nigeria. Well I told Pam that you had visited San \nJuan at the invitation of the county boat licensing office to see how we did \nthings here and Mrs Babbister had invited you to spend a day on my boat \n(naturally she would accompany you). I said to Pam that once we had left Friday \nHarbor you had been overcome with sea-sickness and Mrs Babbister had taken you \nbelow to lie down while I looked for somewhere to anchor. Her delay in coming up \nto see Bruce and her flustered state was because she had been settling you onto \none of the bunks and cleaning up from one particularly widespread vomiting. You \nhad remained below decks because you would not want to be introduced to a \nstranger in your fragile state.<br>\n<br>\nI could tell that Pam was suspicious, but she did seem to be taking in what I \nsaid. Then when I had finished she asked if that was all I had to say. When it \nwas, she thought for a while then said 'This guy Philip, the Nigerian, you're in \ntouch with him by email?' I said I was, so she said 'OK, get him to email me and \ntell me in his own words what happened.' I was momentarily speechless, but then \nsaid the only thing I could, which was 'yes'. So, my friend, I need one huge \nfavour from you please.<br>\n<br>\nCan you email Pam (pamela_munster@yahoo.co.uk) and basically tell her the story \nI gave her, but in your own words. Perhaps you can flesh it out a bit, \nexplaining how Nigeria has a coastline and whales and your government thinks \nthat the tourism opportunities are huge. You could explain how you flew to \nSeattle via Miami, and travelled to San Juan by ferry. Say that you spent a \ncouple of nights in Mrs Miggins' guesthouse and how you enjoyed the island \nalthough the cold was not to your liking, and that you were sorry you didn't \nhave time to visit our home but after the unfortunate incident on the boat you \nneeded to rest. Finally, perhaps you could say how enthusiastic you now are \nabout introducing whale watching in Nigeria. If you could do this for me, I will \nbe eternally grateful.<br>\n<br>\nI received your email about putting the money in a video. Right now I daren't \nmove and certainly daren't touch Pam's money but with your help it will all blow \nover and as soon as it does I'll do exactly as you say.<br>\n<br>\nThank you for helping me in my time of need - I'll not forget it.<br>\n<br>\nCheers, my friend,<br>\n<br>\nHal<br>\n<br>\n",

I am afraid that after 37 years of marriage I take the view that \nit is best to let him get on with it, as indeed I myself get on with it. His \nrelationship with Brenda has already lasted longer than most; Hal is in every \nway a small man and struggles to satisfy anyone for more than a few months.<br>\n<br>\nI haven't yet been able to get to the bottom of whatever scam you and Hal have \nbetween you, but I intend to find out. I do not believe that you have anything \nto do with the tourist industry so I assume that you had a business proposition \nfor Hal. Let me assure you that in this household I deal with the finances and \nmake the decisions, even in respect of Hal's boat and whale watching business. \nHal has about as much business sense as our pet cat and despite the impression \nhe may have given you, any deal which you may be doing is doomed to failure. If \nthere is money to be made, I suggest you discuss your proposition with me.<br>\n<br>\nI look forward to hearing from you.<br>\n<br>\nwith best wishes,<br>\n<br>\nPamela Munster<br>\n<br>\n",
