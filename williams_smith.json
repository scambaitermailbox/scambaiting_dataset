Over 70% of our business is conducted\nover these next three months and is worth many millions of dollars\nto us, so I hope you can appreciate that I cannot allow myself to\nbe involved in anything else at the moment. I have many employees\nwho depend on me to keep things running smoothly.\n\nYou say you have two artists who wish to apply for our donation/scholarship\npayments? Well that is good news, and if they agree to our terms\nthen I am sure that we can be of great help to them.\n\nThe way our programme works is that we seek out new or up and coming\nartists all over the world who may not otherwise be financially\nable to promote or sell their work and then we help them to realise\ntheir full potential. We aid them by presenting them with a scholarship\npayment ranging from $25,000 to $150,000 which again is entirely\ndependent on their potential, but the minimum payment we award any\nartist willing to supply work for us is $25,000. Presently we are\nseeking artists who specialise in wooden sculptures.\n\n\n\n1. Before we could make any kind of monetary payment to any artist\nwe would of course require proof of their abilities. We do not ask\nartists to send in prepared samples of their work because of course\nthere is no way for our foundation to know if the artwork is indeed\nthe artists own work, therefore we would require your artists to\nprovide a brand new sample for us to evaluate their abilities.\n\n2. My company will submit to you (by email attachment) a sample\nphotograph or photographs. This may be of a person, a animal, a\nbuilding or other such item. Your artist would then be required\nto carve a small representation of the image we send to you. Once\nyour have completed the work it is to be sent to us for evaluation\nand then a donation amount would be awarded according to your artists\nskill or potential. Our donation payments range from between a minimum\nof $25,000 up to $150,000.\n\n3. On receipt of a satisfactory piece of artwork my four board members\nwill then gauge the quality and therefore the size of the donation/scholarship\namount to send to you. The payment is sent by whatever means suits\nyou best and is made within 24 hours of receiving your work.\n\n\ngiven in advance of receiving the artwork. It is very important\nthat you understand this completely. You will be responsible for\nshipping the sample to us. Your shipping expenses WILL be refunded\nbut only AFTER we receive the sample.\n\nPlease not also that we can only process one application from one\nartist at a time. Although you state you have TWO artists willing\nto submit work only one at a time will be able to submit a sample.\nOnce your first artist has been paid by us in full for their sample\nthen we can accept the second submission.\n\nI hope that is clear to you, and if you are in agreement to the\nterms above please let me know as soon as possible and I will arrange\nfor a sample picture to be sent to you by email attachment.\nKind regards,\n\nDerek Trotter - Director\nTrotters Fine Arts\nwww.deltrotter.co.uk\n\n\n", "raw": "            <p><b>From:</b> Derek Trotter<br>\n              <b>To:</b> Williams Smith<br>\n              <b>Date:</b> January 13, 2006</p>\n            <p align=\"center\"><img src=\"../images/trotter.gif\" width=\"170\" height=\"35\"></p>\n            <p>&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>Dear Mr. Williams,</p>\n            <p>It is not a case of whether I think your email is &quot;junk&quot; \n              mail or not.

Please\nlet me know if you have any questions.\n\n\n\nAs mentioned on my previous email to you, before we can send you\nthe donation/scholarship payment, you will have to submit a piece\nof work to our requirements. This serves to ensure the work is indeed\nyour own artists work, and also so that we can gauge the quality\nof your artists workmanship.\n\nPlease find attached to this email the sample images. We have taken\ngreat care to photograph the sample images from various angles so\nthat you know exactly the layout of the object, which in this case\nis a dog and a cat sitting on chair. The artist will be required\nto make a carving of this piece in the wood of his/her choice. The\nsample we send has been specially selected to show off various skills.\nPlease note the following rules:\n\n\n1. The carving can be any size you choose. Obviously you will need\nto take into consideration the weight of the carving so that the\nshipping cost is not to great for you, however, remember that we\nwill of course reimburse your shipping costs in full on receipt\nof the artwork. As an example to you, the normal LENGTH of this\nparticular carving along the longest length is 10 inches. You may\nmake your submission larger or smaller but no larger than 15 inches\nalong the longest length.\n\n2. The carving can be in any type of wood that you choose, and must\nNOT be painted. Obviously the quality of the wood, and if possible\na polished smooth finish will increase the chances of your donation\npayment being larger.\n\n\nAttention to detail is important and will help my board members\nto judge the skill of the artist. You will see that the attached\nphotographs have many small details. Try to capture as much detail\nas possible.\n\nwe are presently uncertain of your artists skills, however the closer\nyour artists work is to the supplied sample then the higher the\ndonation payment is likely to be. We realise of course that to exactly\nduplicate the carving would take an artist of exceptional skill,\nso we do not expect the carving to be of such detail and quality,\nhowever the closer to the original artwork that your artist can\nreproduce the sample in wood, the larger the donation amount will\nbe.\n\nPlease bear in mind again that the artwork will have to be shipped\nto us for inspection before the donation payment is given, so obviously\nyou must take into consideration the weight of the artwork so that\nthe shipping cost is not too high for you.\n\nYou will need to ship the completed sample to us by a courier such\nas FedEx or DHL etc. All your shipping fees will be refunded in\nfull but your fees will only be refunded AFTER we receive the completed\nsample. It is not our company policy to pay for work that we have\nnot yet received.\n\nOn receipt of satisfactory artwork we will then judge the skill\nlevel of the artist submission and will reward you with a monetary\ndonation depending on the quality of your work As mentioned previously,\nthe minimum donation amount per artist is $25,000 but this can rise\nup to $150,000 per artist. Note that my board member will usually\npay higher amounts for carvings which have obviously taken great\nskill and time to produce. Donation payment are usually given within\n24 hours of us receiving the sample artwork.\n\nShould your artists be some skill we would then like to make arrangements\nto have some more work produced by you after we have received your\nsample. If this is the case we will of course pay your full fees\nin advance. As a guideline for good quality carvings we tend to\npay between $8,000 - $15,000 per item, so as you can see if your\nartists work is of sufficient quality then you could benefit greatly\nfrom our partnership.\n\nI hope that is of help to you and I look forward to hearing from\nyou soon. If you have any further questions please do not hesitate\nto ask. Please note that once you receive this email and agree to\nour terms your artist must have the carving ready to submit to us\nwithin 4 weeks.\n\nAlso, please let me know when you expect to have the artwork ready\nfor shipping. In the meantime, please can you tell me what your\npreferred method of payment is?\nSincerely,\n\nDerek Trotter - Director\nTrotters Fine Arts\nwww.deltrotter.co.uk\n\n\n\n\n\n", "raw": "            <p><b>From:</b> Derek Trotter<br>\n              <b>To:</b> Williams Smith<br>\n              <b>Date:</b> January 19, 2006</p>\n            <p align=\"center\"><img src=\"../images/trotter.gif\" width=\"170\" height=\"35\"></p>\n            <p>&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>Dear Mr. Williams,<br>\n              <br>\n              Instructions for your or your artist can be found below.
