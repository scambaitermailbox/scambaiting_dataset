Got his voice mail, which features several seconds of dead air instead of his name.  Gave him a new voice mail number for me.)", "July 26:\nVOICE MAIL FROM DR KEN MORGAN\n\nVoice mail received from 832-283-2292. \n\n\n\nTranscript:\n\nYeah Mr Johnson this is Dr Ken Morgan\nuh I just received your message\nuhhhhh could you give me a call\n(unintelligible)\nafter receive this message\nThis is Dr Ken in Houston Texas\nThank you\nand bye for now.", "July 26:\nPHONE CALL WITH DR KEN MORGAN\n\n\nGot a phone card and a pay phone.\n\nHad a contentious call with Dr Ken.  He has poor listening skills. He wasn't really sure where the boxes were to be delivered (of course, they aren't to be delivered).  \n\nAt the start of the call he wasn't giving his name until I told him mine.  He did not appear to be fully aware of the script he was supposed to follow.\n\nAbout 60 seconds in, his phone beeped - I'm fairly sure it was Johnson Konah calling in on a second line. He flashed over to it for about 30 seconds then came back on and was more on script.\n\nHis story: He is a diplomat.  He used his diplomatic passport to keep the boxes from being inspected at the Houston airport but now needs $2500 for an inspection waiver. He said I can't claim the boxes because they are under his passport.  He can't pay the fee because he's just a poor salaried diplomat.  (And besides, the fee doesn't exist.) He needs me to send him the $2500.\n\nFine, I said, we will go together.  I will meet you at the storage company. What is the name of the company?  It's attached to the Houston airport, he said. Fine, what is its name?  He didn't know.  I got pissed off - How could you leave my consignment at a storage company and not get the name of it?  Do you have a phone number for it?  \n\nHis phone beeped, probably Johnson calling in again. When he flashed over to it I hung up on him.  Total call length was 7 minutes, 40 seconds.\n\n\n\n(\nUrgent email sent off to Johnson Konah:\n)", "July 27:\nPHONE CALL WITH DR KEN MORGAN\n\n\nI placed another phone call to Dr Ken Morgan.  I was so pleasant he thought I was a different victim at first.\n\nHe asked for the $2500 to be sent to:\n\nJAMES NGUYEN\n1800 AIRPORT BLVD \nHOUSTON, TX 77079\n\nHe spelled all of that out, painfully slowly.  \n\nHe asked that that payment go via Western Union.  He did not know how to pronounce \"Nguyen\" correctly.  He stated that Mr Nguyen is an accountant with the security company, then changed and stated he is the cash management officer.\n\nI asked where he was staying in Houston. He stated that his son met him at the airport and he can lodge there as long as needed.  I asked how he would deliver the boxes.  He said he will bring the boxes to me via airplane as soon as the waiver is paid and the boxes are claimed from the security company.  The boxes are stored under his diplomatic passport but he needs me to pay for the waiver.  He said that when they landed the inspection people wanted to open the boxes but he would not let them - but he does not know what is in the boxes - so that is why the waiver fee is needed.  I told him my partner will send him $5000.\n\nHe now calls it a security company; yesterday he referred to it as a storage company.\n\n\n\n(Going back into highly frustrating mode:)", "July 27\nVOICE MAIL FROM JOHNSON HAMSON\n\nVoice mail received.\n\nReceived a phone call from Johnson Konah in Abidjan\nVoice mail saved as a WAV file\n\nTranscript:\n\nHello Johnson S......\nplease this is uh Johnson uh your partner from Abidjan\nCote d'Ivoire\nPlease I've been trying to get you online\nand um uh I'm begging you please to help me receive\nthe consignment\nwith Dr Ken Morgan because he's already there in\nAmerica\nPlease (unclear) help me\nI do not know how I don't give you a mail (unclear) in\nyour mail\nplease try for me \nand do not allow the consignment to sit too long.\nThank you\n\n\n(Time to write more obtusely.

I misplaced the paper that had the information about who I was supposed to send a WU to, and he has refused to tell me it. Now how the hell am I supposed to send money to someone without knowing the name?  So I asked him to call me with that information and did he?  DID HE?  NO!  So if you want to rant at someone call him up and rant at him. How can I send money without having the right information?  He never called back with the information! \n\nThis would have been done DAYS ago if Dr Ken Morgan had just given me the bank account information for a transfer.  It sounds like that is a surprise to you but again you don't have experience in American business.  It would have been done immediately.  I could have ordered the transfer OVER THE PHONE and BOOM the money would be there.  No delays like this, no sitting by the phone waiting for Dr Ken Morgan to finally decide to tell me where to send the money.  You say it takes days and weeks to get money out of an account - what would make you think that?  Banks would go out of business if that were the case here.  Maybe that is the way it works in Abidjan but not here. \n\nIt would be DONE.  It's the way business is done.  I tell you I have never used Western Union in my life.  I do not know ANYONE who has EVER used Western Union.  Why not?  Because checks and account transfers are reliable and fast.  But I have acceded to that request.  I am willing to try it. It would be much more efficient to transfer the funds via accounts, and almost as efficient to FedEx a check.

I misplaced the paper that had the information about who I was supposed to send a WU to, and he has refused to tell me it. Now how the hell am I supposed to send money to someone without knowing the name?  So I asked him to call me with that information and did he?  DID HE?  NO!  So if you want to rant at someone call him up and rant at him. How can I send money without having the right information?  He never called back with the information!<br><br> \n\nThis would have been done DAYS ago if Dr Ken Morgan had just given me the bank account information for a transfer.  It sounds like that is a surprise to you but again you don't have experience in American business.  It would have been done immediately.  I could have ordered the transfer OVER THE PHONE and BOOM the money would be there.  No delays like this, no sitting by the phone waiting for Dr Ken Morgan to finally decide to tell me where to send the money.  You say it takes days and weeks to get money out of an account - what would make you think that?  Banks would go out of business if that were the case here.  Maybe that is the way it works in Abidjan but not here.<br><br> \n\nIt would be DONE.  It's the way business is done.  I tell you I have never used Western Union in my life.
