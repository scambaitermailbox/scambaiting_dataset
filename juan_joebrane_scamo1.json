I was just curious how you were going to make me out as an Arab. But as I said, I trust you to have this all worked out so I'm ready to go.You know best since you're an insider. I'll get my passport from the safe deposit box tomorrow and make a scan, and I'll have my secretary pull together the bank information. \n\n<br><br>My phone is 206-XXX-XXXX. That also works as a fax line but we almost never use faxes anymore in this office -- that's dead technology ever since emails and scans came along. (One other thing, you're better to email me since faxes are open for anyone in the office to see. No one sees my private email except for me.)\n\n<br><br>But one thing -- what do you mean by \"I will like to remind you that this entire operation will require expenditure\"? I'm a bit confused -- didn't you say you were preparing to send me money? What expenditure? Will I need to travel? If so, that's no problem, I just need to know what we're talking about here.\n\n<br><br>Trust me -- I'm ready. I'm always ready for money, and the sooner the better. But I can't \"suspend American rap\" -- that's what my business is all about, and that's how I've made my millions. Rap is my life. Well, no, actually I hate rap music personally, but the rap music BUSINESS is my life. There's no way I can give that up even for a day -- I have millions upon millions of fans who count on Reynolds Rap Records and the Astroboy Entertainment Group to satisy their entertainment needs, and I love taking their money. But I can sure as hell handle a business deal at the same time as managing my rap business. I didn't get where I am today by being lazy or stupid!\n\n<br><br>Say, do you want some rap CD's for your own music library? Just let me know and I'll get the latest Garf Kitty-Kat out to you.\n\n<br><br>I'll get you the rest of the details in the morning.\nI gotta run -- I'm meeting with the head of BMG Music at Spago in 20 minutes. Catch you later, Joe my man!\n\n<br><b>MAY 14, 2004:</b> RON SENDS THE INFO<br><br>\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "", "author_role": "bait", "body": "Here's\nmy passport scan.

The dumb broad at the bank suggested two names, but you said I should choose mamambam chambers because he's younger. Is that a good idea? Don't you think maybe we'd be better off choosing someone older, with more experience? Some of these younger guys just don't have the street smarts to handle complex jobs -- they're too wet behind the ears.

He's tops in his field. But since you've got this all mapped out I'll go along with your plan and choose a local lawyer. The dumb broad at the bank suggested two names, but you said I should choose mamambam chambers because he's younger. Is that a good idea? Don't you think maybe we'd be better off choosing someone older, with more experience?

Oh yes, I'm serious. Very serious. I had a most enlighteningmeeting with Juan this morning. Let me give you just a few details from his verylong report:\n\n- Mery Lopez: doesn't exist. She's phony.-- Lawrence Ezeugo:doesn't exist. Phony.-- Matthew Mama: doesn't exist. Another phony.-- JoeBrane: phony, and in deep shit.-- Ali Ashraf: maybe phony, maybe not, but definitelydead. Very, very dead. It seems he died in plane crashes in 1996, 1998, 1999, 2001and 2003. He really got around. He left a lot of cash with a lot of bankers and lawyersin Nigeria, Togo, and Benin. Here are just a very few interesting sites in that regard(I particularly like the first one):\n\nhttp://lists.village.virginia.edu/lists_archive/fixes/3807.htmlhttp://www.potifos.com/fraud/2003-02-10.htmlhttp://www.houseoffusion.com/spam/viewspam.cfm/spamid=43975http://www.obvious.ca/blog/archives/000111.htmlhttp://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/77224http://liste.ferrara.linux.it/archive/crypto/2003-July/000480.htmlhttp://freebsd.kde.org/pipermail/kde-freebsd/2003-September/005845.html\n\nThereare a few hundred more links I could add, but you get the picture.\n\nCuriouslyenough, Joe Brane, Mery Lopez and Matthew Mama all used the exact same computer towrite and send emails, from the same Internet cafe in Cotonou. What an interestingcoincidence!\n\nHave I ever mentioned that Juan is very well connected? I mean,VERY well connected. He has friends in very high places all over the world, and hereally knows how to pull strings when he wants something done. And guess what --he wants something done. Right now. He's pissed. We're talking VERY, VERY, pissed.Royally, majorly, totally pissed. In fact, I've never seen him this pissed. But hehas good reason. You were planning to mug him, maybe even kill him, and steal everything.And he knows it. And, most importantly, he's not happy about it. He says he's goingto make damn sure you pay for it. Big time.\n\nSo the real fun starts now. Rememberwhen I suggested you watch your back? Well, I hope you paid attention because bynow the FBI, Benin Embassy, US State Department, Interpol, and local Cotonou policealready have you in their sights. Juan works fast. You know that Internet cafe Ijust mentioned, the one with the computer that Joe Brane, Mery Lopez, and MatthewMama all used to send their fake emails? The same computer each time?? The one you'resitting at right now?? Well, it's been identified and you're already under surveillance.There's probably an undercover agent watching you right now. Maybe it's the big guysitting near the door. Or the tall guy standing across the street. Or the new guyat the counter. Or all of them... I'm sure you'll find out soon enough.\n\nApparentlyauthorities in west Africa are really starting to crack down hard on 419 advance-feefrauds. They don't like the way scammers like you are tarnishing the reputationsof the millions of decent, honest, and innocent citizens of Benin and Nigeria.\n\nJuantells me the prisons in Benin are not very pleasant. He also tells me that his newcontacts in Cotonou have promised him that your accomodations in that prison willbe especially uncomfortable. Juan made sure some gifts were sent to appropriate peopleto ensure their close cooperation in this regard. \n\nI think you made a big,big mistake, my friend.

She's phony.<br>-- Lawrence Ezeugo:doesn't exist. Phony.<br>-- Matthew Mama: doesn't exist. Another phony.<br>-- JoeBrane: phony, and in deep shit.<br>-- Ali Ashraf: maybe phony, maybe not, but definitelydead. Very, very dead. It seems he died in plane crashes in 1996, 1998, 1999, 2001and 2003. He really got around. He left a lot of cash with a lot of bankers and lawyersin Nigeria, Togo, and Benin. Here are just a very few interesting sites in that regard(I particularly like the first one):\n\n<br><br>http://lists.village.virginia.edu/lists_archive/fixes/3807.html<br>http://www.potifos.com/fraud/2003-02-10.html<br>http://www.houseoffusion.com/spam/viewspam.cfm/spamid=43975<br>http://www.obvious.ca/blog/archives/000111.html<br>http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/77224<br>http://liste.ferrara.linux.it/archive/crypto/2003-July/000480.html<br>http://freebsd.kde.org/pipermail/kde-freebsd/2003-September/005845.html\n\n<br><br>Thereare a few hundred more links I could add, but you get the picture.\n\n<br><br>Curiouslyenough, Joe Brane, Mery Lopez and Matthew Mama all used the exact same computer towrite and send emails, from the same Internet cafe in Cotonou. What an interestingcoincidence!\n\n<br><br>Have I ever mentioned that Juan is very well connected? I mean,VERY well connected. He has friends in very high places all over the world, and hereally knows how to pull strings when he wants something done. And guess what --he wants something done. Right now. He's pissed. We're talking VERY, VERY, pissed.Royally, majorly, totally pissed. In fact, I've never seen him this pissed. But hehas good reason. You were planning to mug him, maybe even kill him, and steal everything.And he knows it. And, most importantly, he's not happy about it. He says he's goingto make damn sure you pay for it. Big time.\n\n<br><br>So the real fun starts now. Rememberwhen I suggested you watch your back? Well, I hope you paid attention because bynow the FBI, Benin Embassy, US State Department, Interpol, and local Cotonou policealready have you in their sights. Juan works fast. You know that Internet cafe Ijust mentioned, the one with the computer that Joe Brane, Mery Lopez, and MatthewMama all used to send their fake emails? The same computer each time?? The one you'resitting at right now?? Well, it's been identified and you're already under surveillance.There's probably an undercover agent watching you right now. Maybe it's the big guysitting near the door. Or the tall guy standing across the street. Or the new guyat the counter. Or all of them... I'm sure you'll find out soon enough.\n\n<br><br>Apparentlyauthorities in west Africa are really starting to crack down hard on 419 advance-feefrauds. They don't like the way scammers like you are tarnishing the reputationsof the millions of decent, honest, and innocent citizens of Benin and Nigeria.\n\n<br><br>Juantells me the prisons in Benin are not very pleasant. He also tells me that his newcontacts in Cotonou have promised him that your accomodations in that prison willbe especially uncomfortable. Juan made sure some gifts were sent to appropriate peopleto ensure their close cooperation in this regard. \n\n<br><br>I think you made a big,big mistake, my friend. And you thought the bodyguard was the worst of your problems......\n\n", "comments": []}]}
