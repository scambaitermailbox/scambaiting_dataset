Unlike\nother economies,  African countries do not  operate on fixed taxation\nbecause their economies are largely unstable.  A lot of these countries\nsuffer from corrupt and inept  leadership, mismanagement of funds,\nplundering of State resources, etc. These vices cause huge\nimpoverishment on the people, attract  inflation and make  the\nleadership (citizens) perpetual beneficiaries of foreign assistance from\nthe World  Bank, International Monetary Fund, etc. However, not all\nthe 5% will be charged as transfer cost.

Moreover, payment will  be by\ncash,  lawful  United States  Cash dollar currency.  The bank\nclassifies this deposit as a  'cross-border deposit initiative' thereby\nputting it under cross-border  payment category. Funds placed in this\ncategory as defined by ECOWAS laws/statutes, are funds transferred\nacross  sub-regional  borders and sourced  from conflict zones, war,\ndevastation  by Natural occurences, hostile  political\nleadership/repression, etc. ECOWAS is a sub-regional West African\nEconomic & Trade Organisation   (Economic Community of West African\nStates), made  up of the 15 nation West African  Countries saddled with\nthe responsibility  of maintaining\n  and  supervising trade, business, and banking  activities within the\nWest  African sub-region.

Beneficiary is expected to  receive the  cash deposit from\nthe Bank  Manager and take it to another bank of international value and\nacceptance for lodgment. He has therefore  recommended the Standard\nChartered Bank for  you.

As you rightly stated in your letter, we will surely have\nmore issues to discuss as time goes on. I have taken note of the matters\nyou have raised and I will respond accordingly. The draft Agreement will\nget to you early next week, I am trying to find out from the Bank if\nthere will be some deposit related issues that may find relevance in the\nterms of Agreement. If nothing of importance comes up from that 'angle'\nthen you will have the draft earlier. \n\nI believe we should be satisfied with the fact that my client is willing\nto invest in Eastern Europe or the C.I.S. His unfortunate predicament\nand loss of colossal assets in Liberia has not 'closed' him up from\ncontacts with one or two credible financial consultants. Although I am\nalso aware that some taxation are imposed on funds moved into the United\nStates, along with discreet trail over the source (September 11th), 35%\nmay sound ridiculous, but for funds coming in from Africa or the Middle\nEast, you never, never can tell. The United States and United Kingdom\ngovernments are aware that several African leaders including big-time\npoliticians, retired Military Generals, etc loot their nation's treasury\ndry and transfer billions of dollars to Europe and North America. The U.\nS. will surely like to have a 'bite' out of these 'apples' knowing too\nwell that these monies were sourced from unconventional means. Funds\nfrom the middle East is a different matter entirely, if it gets into the\nU.S, first of all it may be seized, long investigation, released, etc\nall to prove that it's not coming in to sponsor terrorism.

As you rightly stated in your letter, we will surely have\nmore issues to discuss as time goes on. I have taken note of the matters\nyou have raised and I will respond accordingly. The draft Agreement will\nget to you early next week, I am trying to find out from the Bank if\nthere will be some deposit related issues that may find relevance in the\nterms of Agreement. If nothing of importance comes up from that 'angle'\nthen you will have the draft earlier. \n<br><br>\nI believe we should be satisfied with the fact that my client is willing\nto invest in Eastern Europe or the C.I.S. His unfortunate predicament\nand loss of colossal assets in Liberia has not 'closed' him up from\ncontacts with one or two credible financial consultants. Although I am\nalso aware that some taxation are imposed on funds moved into the United\nStates, along with discreet trail over the source (September 11th), 35%\nmay sound ridiculous, but for funds coming in from Africa or the Middle\nEast, you never, never can tell. The United States and United Kingdom\ngovernments are aware that several African leaders including big-time\npoliticians, retired Military Generals, etc loot their nation's treasury\ndry and transfer billions of dollars to Europe and North America. The U.\nS. will surely like to have a 'bite' out of these 'apples' knowing too\nwell that these monies were sourced from unconventional means. Funds\nfrom the middle East is a different matter entirely, if it gets into the\nU.S, first of all it may be seized, long investigation, released, etc\nall to prove that it's not coming in to sponsor terrorism.

Internet communication is not safe\nand secure, besides for a project of this magnitude, institutions and\ncritical individuals involved (e.g Bank Manager), will be thoroughly\nupset if I engage in such unauthorized publicity.

They know what to do; but you cannot escape payment for all\nthese services; b ut it's negotiable.\n<br><br>\nLewd, this the major unforeseen, it may be huge, I can't tell. Do not be\nafraid over this, I assure you. Our client is not familiar with this\nprocedure, but is aware of the 5% mapped out as refunds and 5% retained\nby the bank. For your information, the bank (paying bank) has complete\nresponsibility in offering advice and directives suitable to the fluid\nexecution of this project. We listen to them.\n<br><br>\nOur client is a Liberian Industrialist who controlled vast diamond mines\nin Liberia and Republic of Sierra Leone. At the moment he's on political\nasylum in Southern Africa. He is a target of elimination by two (2)\nRebel groups who actively participated in the 14 years Liberian war.\nWhen we meet I will disclose his name to you, to do so through\ncyberspace will be improper at this time; besides he's a target of\nassassins.\n<br><br>\nEqually, I crave your indulgence to decline critical disclosures through\nthis medium to you in the interim. Internet communication is not safe\nand secure, besides for a project of this magnitude, institutions and\ncritical individuals involved (e.g Bank Manager), will be thoroughly\nupset if I engage in such unauthorized publicity. In the words of Ralph\nWaldo Emerson''the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps\nwith perfect sweetness the independence of solitude'' it is only with\nthe heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to\nthe eye. We are all aware of computer freaks, hackers, US Intelligence\nsystems, etc, I will not risk such detailed disclosures at this stage,\none damn individual may be omewhere waiting ? perhaps to burgle the\nbank! When you arrive, you will see things for yourself. It is often\nsaid that the good things in life are like the birth of a child. Ninety\npercent waiting?.\n<br><br>\nAlso, all contacts at Standard Chartered Bank Accra will be provided by\nthe bank manager (Paying Bank). I have no knowledge of this individual\nat (SCB) at the moment, but the manager is in-charge of that. In fact he\nhas perfected every arrangement regarding the account opening etc. Don't\nworry, you will receive credible advice and assistance. It is always\npossible to approach a goal by a detour, that is what the manager is\ndoing. I hope you do realize that several millions of dollars is\ninvolved here, handling such an exercise is not done by lying on a\nfeather bed nor under a canopy. All parties must be tactful. Please do\nnot take offence over my blunt clarifications, it is due to the\nsensitive nature of the transaction. I have to give you the true picture\nof events, unnecessary attention is not desired. I need your full\nco-operation and I assure you a wonderful business ransaction.\n<br><br>\nPlease as soon as your flight is confirmed kindly let me know your\nflight details, time of arrival to Ghana, this will enable me receive\nyou at the airport, Accra.\n<br><br>\nI look forward to a wonderful, trusting, transparent relationship with\nyou.

Oh\nno! Never you think like that. Although we have not met, I have taken\nyou as a true friend; a true friend unbosoms freely, advices justly,\nassists readily, adventures boldly, takes all patiently, defends\ncourageously, and continues a friend unchangeably. Relax your mind\ncomrade, we are not in the dark ages neither is Africa a continent of\ncannibals. Gosh! Why do you rush to such far flung conclusion? Too bad.\n\nOur client is not and never a mystery. His name is Philip Ahoua and for\nyour information he is presently suffering from terminal ailment ?\ncancer. Specialists in southern Africa have given up, perhaps he may not\nsurvive up to 6 years. Well, that may not be important to you. What I\nbelieve you should bother about is' 'Okon  Henshaw, do you have the\npower of Attorney to execute this project'' The answer is irrevocably '\nyes. The bank is not bothered about him, all Philip knows is that the\nfunds will be safely invested in a promising enterprise ' Eastern\nEurope. Our client was accused of being too close to the Ex- President\nof Liberia 'C.T', now on self-exile in South Eastern Nigeria. Several\nmembers of cabinet, friends, families, etc of the Ex-Head of State have\nsecured political asylum within and outside Africa. If the deposit\nweren't lodged in a Ghanaian Bank, nothing would have brought us\ntogether. All men of means were hunted during the Liberian war. It is\nthe usual occurrence during war; such attacks are not restricted to\nAfrica, are you not aware? Thank God Philip was not hacked to death in\nLiberia. He is a good man.\n\nNow, you call the project 'illegal', 'dark money', etc. I presume you\nshould know better than to say that. Across the civilized world and\nindeed amongst humanity, there is no clean money. Behind every great\nfortune there is a crime. Even within the world's greatest banking\ninstitution, crime and fraud thrives. Recently a US Senate hearing was\ntold that multilateral development banks, including the world bank, have\nmisused about $200 billion meant for development projects in poor\ncountries of the world. The world bank is an agency of the United\nNations. An expert Jeffrey Winters, Associate Professor of Political\nScience at North-Western University in the US added that a probe into\nInter-American Development Bank (IDB), European Bank For\nReconstruction & Development, Asian Development Bank and African\nDevelopment Bank, will shoot the scandal to over $40 billion. So Lewd\nwhat do you think? African Presidents and Heads of States both living\nand dead have looted their nation's treasuries dry. Are you not aware?\nLewd haven't you heard of late Jean Bedel-Bokassa of Central African\nRepublic, late Idi-Amin of Uganda, late Mobutu Sese-seku of former Zaire\n(now DRC), late Gen. Sanni Abacha of Nigeria, etc current leaders in\nNigeria, Togo, Zambia, Zimbabwe, etc are more or less 'emperors'. All\ntogether over $3 trillion has been siphoned to Europe and North America\nby these 'Rulers', since the mid 70's. You can contact appropriate\nauthorities for your individual enquiries.\n\nAcross Asia, South America, North America, etc several financial\nscandals of unimaginable proportion assault our sensibilities day and\nnight. I am sure you are aware of the fact that Moscow has over taken\nNew York as the billionaires' capital of the world. According to The\nIndependent of London'' no other city in the world can boast of such a\nlarge number of billionaires, even New York. There are 36 billionaires\nin Moscow alone ? Elena Baturina (41 years old), Viktor Vekselberg (47\nyears old, Russia's third-richest man worth $5.9bn). The richest man in\nRussia Mikhail Khodorkousky, 40 years old former Chief Executive of oil\ngiant Yukos, is awaiting trial in Moscow's Malaya Tishinskaya prison,\naccused of tax fraud and theft. Lewd, the world's richest man Bill Gates\nis still facing Anti-trust suits in America. Multi-national\nCorporations, Enron, Halliburton, etc are riddled with high scale\ncorruption and fraud. US Vice-President Dick Cheney presided over\nHalliburton before becoming the US Vice 'President. While he was\ncontrolling Halliburton, an oil service company, he approved the payment\nof a bribe totaling US$280 million in order to secure a $4 billion\nLiquefied Natural Gas contract in Nigeria. These are facts. Now tell me\nwhich is 'bright' money and which is 'dark money'. Who has ever audited\nthe account of the Vatican in Rome? Are you aware of the operational\nstyle of Banco Ambrosiano in Italy? Do you know the worth of the Vatican\nin terms of liquid deposit? In the words of George Farquhar'. 'Tis still\nmy maxim, that there is no scandal like rags, nor any crime so shameful\nas poverty'' In my opinion Lewd, I will rather say there is no legal\nmoney on earth, especially in the capitalist world. \n\nAccordingly, you have no need whatsoever  to spend your money on hunky\nbodyguards, freaks emerging from dark alleys to monitor your movement or\ndo whatever. It is absolutely unnecessary and ridiculous, to say the\nleast. I am quite free here and I don't need any security cover. And\nwhile you are here your security is my security and all I need is your\nfull cooperation to invest these funds in Eastern Europe. I am not\ninviting you in other to harm you, why, because you are coming to assist\nme to invest our funds. The advantages of working in the Kremlin may be\nuseful in Iraq or Iran or better still Israel. But not in the sweet,\nlittle country where even kidnapping is not in their lexicon. Again\nLewd, the idea of coming over with hunks should be eliminated\ncompletely.\n\nSO ON OTHER ISSUES:\n\n1.\tI explained clearly to you why we should not peddle names of\nInstitutions or Bank officials you will be meeting over a porous\nfacility like  the Internet. I really want you to trust me and see\nreason with me; moreover the bank manager has advised that such\ndisclosures should be made when beneficiary arrives due to the sensitive\nnature of this transaction. Please trust me and exercise patience until\nyou arrives Ghana where we will have time to discuss one-on-one.\n\n2.\tOur client  is not any way involved in these final stages of the\ntransaction, we have no need to pester him about any advance payment,\nbesides I wonder where you got the idea of advance / upfront payment\nfrom? I am only aware of the $9,500.00 sundry charge you will pay to the\nbank for the use of the Bullion van/Police Escorts. Where else are you\nmaking payment? At the time of lodging the Deposit, enough cash will be\navailable to settle bank charges. From the 5% set aside we will refund\nany personal expenses that you are incurring e.g your air ticket fares\nto & fro, administrative charge, account  opening, etc.\n\n3.\tI believe since it is the bank manager who recommended Standard\nChartered Bank for you, it will be appropriate for him to respond and\naddress all issues related to the SCB directly to you once you arrive.\nDo not take offence or rush into doing things on your own at the\ndetriment of this project.\n\nI am pleased to realize that you are in Latvia, I guess a small city\nstate with a population of less than 3 million. I understand it shares\nboundary with Russia, Belarus and the Baltic Sea. How is city life in\nRiga and Daugaupils? Riga is allegedly home of the first decorated\nChristmas  tree in the year 1510. The 'Riga tree' was burned after being\nused in ceremonies that combined Christian and pagan customs. What are\ntheir controlling laws over foreign investments or inflow of foreign\ncapital?\n\nMs. LeFay is welcomed to this beautiful city of Africa. There are\nthousands of tourists arriving here from Asia, Europe and North America,\nshe will blend very well in Accra. Well, her choice of dressing is\nunique, not strange out here, but if you wish, there are choice\nboutiques where you will be able to pick up 'Chador' or an Abaya' for\nher to wear. Moreover, we will present her with African fabrics for her\nto wear. She will look damn gorgeous, except that you will have to go\nunderneath to 'check-out' her 'assets', wow!\n\nLewd, it is an age old African tradition to exchange gifts when an\nimportant visitor arrives. I am aware of the fact that the bank\nmanager/Accountant, etc are arranging a beautiful work of traditional\nAfrican Art piece for you. On  your part, kindly reciprocate by bringing\nover some gifts for the bank manager, Accountant and two (2) officials\nof the Security Deposit Commission that will assist you. You may think\nof anything, but if you ask me, I will suggest a good quality Nokia or\nSamsung (Dual band GSM 900/1800) mobile phone. I suggest the latest in\nthe Nokia or Samsung series with all standard features. It will be a\nthrill to these folks, a great thrill that will attract unusual favours\nto you.\n\nWell, I guess I have talked a lot. I don't want grief, so I remain on\nthe sunny side of life. Grief is the agony  of an instant, to indulge in\nit is a blunder of life! Stay alive Lewd, I am looking forward to seeing\nyou.

You've already mentioned the name\nof the receiving bank, why all the secrecy about the bank where the\nfunds are currently deposited?\n\nI absolutely do not understand why you are not willing to divulge the\nwebsite of the Standard Chartered Bank. I just want to view the site and\ndetermine what kind of transactions will be available online. Henshaw,\nlet's not leave everything to the last minute.\n\nRegarding the comment that we have no need to pester the client about\nadvance payment and that you wonder where I got the idea about advance\npayment from to begin with: Henshaw, I don't regard working out details\nto everyones satisfactiion as 'pestering'. If this 'pesters' our friend\nPhilip Ahoua, then he's in the wrong business. And as far as where I got\nthe idea from, why, it came from you Henshaw. Listen, you and Mr. Ahoua\nhave determined that 5%, or $5.25 million has been set aside for\n\"...likely, unforseen expenses\". Just the magnitude of that estimated\namount indicates to me that more charges are coming. Actually, I don't\nunderstand why the need for anything to be set aside, let alone $5.25\nmillioin. If you have power of attorney over the account then that's\nwhere money for any fees, charges, or any other unforseen expenses.\nInstead of an advance payment why not just migrate a percentage of the\ntotal to one of your own accounts for use during the transaction. After\nthis is all over we really must get you out of Ghana to see how things\nare done in the rest of the world.\n\nI believe you asked earlier the extent of Ms. LeFay's involvement\nin this deal. I give Morgan information on a need-to-know basis. Her\nprimary function is to accompany me to any business meeting we have with\nthe people involved there. I have found just her presence in a meeting\nto be invaluable in distracting and keeping those on the other side of\nthe table unfocused. \n\nHenshaw, you've either been reading too many spy novels or watching too\nmany American movies. Nobody is talking about 'hunky bodyguards', as you\nput it. The people I referred to are somewhat more, shall we say,\nprofessional. And I'm not paying to bring anyone there; the people we\nwill use are already there.\n\nI will be flying from Amsterdam to Accra on Saturday. Ms. LeFay\nis in Amsterdam now taking care of visas and she may come a day or two\nearlier. We won't be needing hotel accomodations or pickup at the\nairport, but thanks for the offer. I don't want tyou to have to wait\naround the airport all day and you never know when a flight is going to\nbe late. \n\nThe address where we will be staying is F856/1 Ring Road East, 13 Lane,\nthere in Accra. I intend to spend Saturday renewing some old\naquaintences and you and I can meet on Sunday. Please send me the\naddress of your office and we can meet you there, say 10:00am?

Noogie</font></h3>\n\nHenshaw,<br><br>\n\nLet me address a few items from your Friday email.\n<br><br>\nYou mentioned not peddling names of institutions or bank officials over\na porous facility like the internet. You've already mentioned the name\nof the receiving bank, why all the secrecy about the bank where the\nfunds are currently deposited?\n<br><br>\nI absolutely do not understand why you are not willing to divulge the\nwebsite of the Standard Chartered Bank. I just want to view the site and\ndetermine what kind of transactions will be available online. Henshaw,\nlet's not leave everything to the last minute.<br><br>\n\nRegarding the comment that we have no need to pester the client about\nadvance payment and that you wonder where I got the idea about advance\npayment from to begin with: Henshaw, I don't regard working out details\nto everyones satisfactiion as 'pestering'. If this 'pesters' our friend\nPhilip Ahoua, then he's in the wrong business. And as far as where I got\nthe idea from, why, it came from you Henshaw. Listen, you and Mr. Ahoua\nhave determined that 5%, or $5.25 million has been set aside for\n\"...likely, unforseen expenses\". Just the magnitude of that estimated\namount indicates to me that more charges are coming. Actually, I don't\nunderstand why the need for anything to be set aside, let alone $5.25\nmillioin. If you have power of attorney over the account then that's\nwhere money for any fees, charges, or any other unforseen expenses.\nInstead of an advance payment why not just migrate a percentage of the\ntotal to one of your own accounts for use during the transaction. After\nthis is all over we really must get you out of Ghana to see how things\nare done in the rest of the world.<br><br>\n\nI believe you asked earlier the extent of Ms. LeFay's involvement\nin this deal. I give Morgan information on a need-to-know basis. Her\nprimary function is to accompany me to any business meeting we have with\nthe people involved there. I have found just her presence in a meeting\nto be invaluable in distracting and keeping those on the other side of\nthe table unfocused. \n<br><br>\nHenshaw, you've either been reading too many spy novels or watching too\nmany American movies. Nobody is talking about 'hunky bodyguards', as you\nput it. The people I referred to are somewhat more, shall we say,\nprofessional. And I'm not paying to bring anyone there; the people we\nwill use are already there.\n<br><br>\nI will be flying from Amsterdam to Accra on Saturday. Ms. LeFay\nis in Amsterdam now taking care of visas and she may come a day or two\nearlier. We won't be needing hotel accomodations or pickup at the\nairport, but thanks for the offer. I don't want tyou to have to wait\naround the airport all day and you never know when a flight is going to\nbe late. <br><br>\n\nThe address where we will be staying is F856/1 Ring Road East, 13 Lane,\nthere in Accra. I intend to spend Saturday renewing some old\naquaintences and you and I can meet on Sunday. Please send me the\naddress of your office and we can meet you there, say 10:00am? By the\nway, I don't think you ever mentioned the name of your company?<br><br>\n\nI am truly touched by the fact that the bank officials are arranging a\npiece of traditional African art as a gift for me.

How do I start responding to such a sweet letter from Morgan dated\nJune 15. 2004. I deeply appreciate your comments regarding my\ncorrespondence with you. Well,  Morgan I really wanted to keep this to\nmyself but...... your letters are equally terrific, luxuriant and a\ndelight to read. I look forward to our meeting, I just can't wait!\n\nI'm pleased to realise that contents of my last mail were clearly\nunderstood; hope I didn't  bore you. I guess it was quite lengthy, so\nsorry I didn't want to miss out essential details which may appear a bit\ninsignificant,\nbut or prime importance here. Is this your first  trip to Africa? The\nBank appointment for June 28 is certain and confirmed, as adviced take\ngood care of the cash funds you're coming with. I trust you. One thing\nthough, when flying in from London, i.e. London ' Accra, just dress\ncasual, perhaps a lovely tee-shirt over a denim (jeans)  trouser. Yes,\nAfrica is quite developed and all that but with your  'looks' (beauty\nqueen) any ostentatious dressing will have Airport paparazzi flocking\nall over you! I'll be upset to see your face in the morning tabloids\n(all men are jealous). However Morgan be very casual. Furthermore, thanks\nover the acceptance to pick up the GSM phone gifts from London. I hope\nthey fit in snugly in your suitcase.\n\nPlease note; the GSM acceptable here is band 900/1800.\nNight life in Accra is simply awesome. We'll have some spare time to\nboogie, I love dancing too and you really need to let off steam.\nNovosibirsk must really be boring and you do deserve a change.

How do I start responding to such a sweet letter from Morgan dated\nJune 15. 2004. I deeply appreciate your comments regarding my\ncorrespondence with you. Well,  Morgan I really wanted to keep this to\nmyself but...... your letters are equally terrific, luxuriant and a\ndelight to read. I look forward to our meeting, I just can't wait!\n<br><br>\nI'm pleased to realise that contents of my last mail were clearly\nunderstood; hope I didn't  bore you. I guess it was quite lengthy, so\nsorry I didn't want to miss out essential details which may appear a bit\ninsignificant,\nbut or prime importance here. Is this your first  trip to Africa? The\nBank appointment for June 28 is certain and confirmed, as adviced take\ngood care of the cash funds you're coming with. I trust you. One thing\nthough, when flying in from London, i.e. London ' Accra, just dress\ncasual, perhaps a lovely tee-shirt over a denim (jeans)  trouser. Yes,\nAfrica is quite developed and all that but with your  'looks' (beauty\nqueen) any ostentatious dressing will have Airport paparazzi flocking\nall over you! I'll be upset to see your face in the morning tabloids\n(all men are jealous). However Morgan be very casual. Furthermore, thanks\nover the acceptance to pick up the GSM phone gifts from London. I hope\nthey fit in snugly in your suitcase.<br><br>\n\nPlease note; the GSM acceptable here is band 900/1800.<br><br>\nNight life in Accra is simply awesome. We'll have some spare time to\nboogie, I love dancing too and you really need to let off steam.\nNovosibirsk must really be boring and you do deserve a change.

I think I told you about her; she's an old friend who works\nat the Russian embassy here in London that I haven't seen in a long time\nand we stayed up most of the night catching up on old times. Lewis knew\nher back when he worked for one of the Georgian state security services\nand he introduced her to me. We look a lot alike and are sometimes\nmistaken for sisters. Maybe I should get her to come to Accra with me;\nyou would REALLY have your hands full then :-))\n\nNatasha asked me why I am going to Accra and I just said that I'm\nsitting in for Lewis in a business transaction. Natasha, ever the\nsuspicious one (you know how these security people are), asked me a\nbunch of questions about this deal, most of which I was not able to\nanswer because of the terrible shape that Lewis keeps his files in.\nLewis also told me to keep any details confidential. One thing she asked\nthat I didn't know was the name of your company. I have to admit that\nnever occurred to me! I felt like such a dummy! Henshaw, what IS the\nname of your company? I don't see why that would be any kind of secret.\n\nWe're going shopping later today so I can buy some summer dresses and\nsuch. I want to look especially nice for you while I'm there.

One thing she asked\nthat I didn't know was the name of your company. I have to admit that\nnever occurred to me! I felt like such a dummy! Henshaw, what IS the\nname of your company?

I\nhave not disclosed this development to any person, friend or foe. I\nremain calm, quiet and discrete that is what the Bank wants, because no\nbank is willing to loose its operational licence if this matter is known\nto government of Ghana. Why would I display pride, arrogance or whatever\njust because of this deposit. No I will not, remember what I told you\nabout my wife and her wealthy parents?

I think it's a better idea than to do things and be labeled a\nDRUG BARON. \n\nThere are several reasons why the Bank has placed caution on the conduct\nof the beneficiaries. I'll tell you just one. Morgan, the American\nGovernment has sent Anti-Terrorist crack intelligence units into many\nAfrican countries to sniff out huge private deposits in Banks and\nquestion the account owners. All Banks in Africa are aware of this and\nthey've cautioned their customers. If you are traced and questioned, the\nUnited States has the power to fly you out straight to Washington for\nsever interrogation; at once you'll be accused of working for or working\nwith middle East terrorists. Morgan, is that not enough reason to be\ncareful? When you go renting a whole floor of a 5 star hotel, you are\nonly calling for trouble here in this little country, Accra. I am not\nblind nor stupid in not recommending suites at Golden Tulip or Labadi\nBeach or even Novotel. If you're coming strictly for holidays and you\ncan afford to pay those rates, oh well, no problems. But for this\nprojects Morgan, three, four or five nights in a decent hotel will not\nmake you loose your worth. Let us secure the deposit first and all other\nthings will follow- I promise you. \n\nTHE PICK UP PLAN: \nI did present your letter to the Bank Manager, and I tell you Morgan, the\nBank folks were disappointed. Especially the accountant. Since you've\ndecided to involve the Embassy folks in all these without even seeking\nmy advice, the Bank has declined to honour your appointment. I'm still\npleading with them to have you come over since I'm not too sure you've\ngone ahead to involve Natasha in all this. But if you've done that and\nthe Russian Embassy people will be there to welcome you, forget it\nMorgan, I will no longer come for you and the project will be called off.\nYou may fly back to Latvia from London, that's the way it is. Well, some\nweeks back, I told Lewd how sensitive the Banks here act over huge\ndeposit related matters. It's no joke because western powers and the\nUnited States have spies crawling all over Africa to pounce on several\nhard earned fortunes. I tell you my dear lady, they are quite stern;\nbelieve me.\n\n That said, sweetheart, I hope you've not acted out of impulse to\ninvolve the Russian folks. If you've gone ahead too bad, but if you\ntrust me to keep you in wonderful place, I'll go back to the Bank and\nnotify the Manager. Don't do anything that will make Lewd get upset with\nyou. I'm really anxious to receive you in Accra on 26th June, 2004.\nPlease be wise. \n\nIn the words of Thomas Kelly.....

If you are traced and questioned, the\nUnited States has the power to fly you out straight to Washington for\nsever interrogation; at once you'll be accused of working for or working\nwith middle East terrorists. Morgan, is that not enough reason to be\ncareful? When you go renting a whole floor of a 5 star hotel, you are\nonly calling for trouble here in this little country, Accra. I am not\nblind nor stupid in not recommending suites at Golden Tulip or Labadi\nBeach or even Novotel. If you're coming strictly for holidays and you\ncan afford to pay those rates, oh well, no problems. But for this\nprojects Morgan, three, four or five nights in a decent hotel will not\nmake you loose your worth. Let us secure the deposit first and all other\nthings will follow- I promise you. \n<br><br>\nTHE PICK UP PLAN: <br>\nI did present your letter to the Bank Manager, and I tell you Morgan, the\nBank folks were disappointed. Especially the accountant. Since you've\ndecided to involve the Embassy folks in all these without even seeking\nmy advice, the Bank has declined to honour your appointment. I'm still\npleading with them to have you come over since I'm not too sure you've\ngone ahead to involve Natasha in all this. But if you've done that and\nthe Russian Embassy people will be there to welcome you, forget it\nMorgan, I will no longer come for you and the project will be called off.\nYou may fly back to Latvia from London, that's the way it is. Well, some\nweeks back, I told Lewd how sensitive the Banks here act over huge\ndeposit related matters. It's no joke because western powers and the\nUnited States have spies crawling all over Africa to pounce on several\nhard earned fortunes. I tell you my dear lady, they are quite stern;\nbelieve me.\n<br><br>\n That said, sweetheart, I hope you've not acted out of impulse to\ninvolve the Russian folks. If you've gone ahead too bad, but if you\ntrust me to keep you in wonderful place, I'll go back to the Bank and\nnotify the Manager. Don't do anything that will make Lewd get upset with\nyou. I'm really anxious to receive you in Accra on 26th June, 2004.\nPlease be wise. \n<br><br>\nIn the words of Thomas Kelly..... 'the life that intends to be wholly\nobedient, wholly submissive, wholly listening, is astonishing in its\ncompleteness. Its joys are ravishing, its peace profound, its humility\nthe deepest, its power world shaking, its love enveloping , its\nsimplicity that of a trusting child..' \n<br><br>\nTell your friend that I will take proper care of you right from the\nAirport and to Our hotel.Ghanaians are not cannibals.This project means\nalot to us.You're safe,don't panic.Get a number from Natasha,as soon as\nyou arrive Ghana you can call her to say everything ok,when you might\nhave seen things yourself.Don't drag further,ok.I care for you always.\nThanks for the Company's suggestion.I await the suggested name.

I'm quite sure you never expected my response after words like 'Henshaw\ndear, you jerkoff , you asshole, you scamming dickhead! Cutting you loose,\nkicking you to the curb' ... Morgan, are these the right words to be used on a\nman you dreamt of marrying? Nature gave horns to bulls, hooves to horses, speed\nto hares, the power of swimming to fishes, that of flying to birds, and\nunderstanding to men. She had nothing left to give to women save.... bolting-\nhutch of beastliness. Such is thy audacious wickedness, thy lewd, pestiferous\nand dissentious prank, very similar to the prattle of infant pride. Morgan, we\ncourt disaster when we carry childish perceptions into the dynamics of life,\nrelationship, business etc. \n\nI'm not a fraudster neither do I engaged in fraud or take delight in being\nfraudulent. Your 'sick' and unfounded allegations of scams, '419' advance fee\nfraudsters, etc are well 'worn, common and very pedestrian. You think I don't\nknow about the existence of 419 or I've not seen several, I repeat, several\nwebsites on 419 fraud on the Internet? Oh!

You need that. At the moment Morgan, I'm in\nKumasi and I'll be back to Accra on the 20th of July. I copied your mail ' 'the\n419 mail' to the Bank Management. A decision has been taken on the deposit,\nthis I'll inform you at the end of this letter. In the interim Morgan, I'm very\nhurt and angry.

Your hard heart is buttoned up with\nsteel.. pitiless and rough. You are not worth the dust which the rude wind\nblows in your face. In civility Morgan, you are absolutely empty. Do you really\nwish that your 'name and phone number' should be written on every public rest\nroom wall in the city of Novosibirsk? Be careful of what you wish yourself\nbaby! Looking at your picture (if is really you) you have an angelic face, but\nheaven knows your heart ' an evil soul producing 'holy' witness is like a\nvillain with a smiling cheek, a goodly apple rotten at the heart.

If there is\nanything worse than the rage, the frustration, and the other negative things\nthat come of us, it is the things that do not come out! Festering wounds are\ndangerous wounds. \n\nTHE '419' SAGA: \nYou called me all sorts. Okay. But the Bank doesn't call me any name neither\ndoes anyone in this country and overseas. We are all aware of 419 and it\npractices through cyberspace. Natasha is professionally competent to tell you\nall about the 419 scam and lead you to engaging websites, just to warn you. As\nan ex-Georgian State Security personnel and a current Russian spy in the United\nKingdom, she'll go to the extreme to tell-it-all. That's none of my business\nbecause I'm not into that. But I guess you needed that tutelage. \n\nMorgan, I'm versatile enough to know that the scam of 419 is a counterfeit\nfraudulent act by specialized syndicates all over the world to con money out of\nvery gullible victims ' black and white. It has it roots in Nigeria, one of\nAfrica's richest countries and the most populous black nation on earth '\npopulation is over 150million. \nNigeria is the world's sixth largest producer of crude oil but sadly its huge\nfortunes earned through sales of crude oil, has been corruptly diverted to\nforeign accounts by successive political military leadership. This has brought\nso much impoverishment to the masses of that great country. Simply but Morgan,\nthe impoverished populace rudely aware that for over 40 years after\nindependence, the Western world including the United States have been\nbenefiting from billions and billions of dollars stolen from the public vault\nby corrupt leaders without sanctions from those countries now devised the '419'\nformular to fleece off gullible citizens of the recipient countries. \n\nNow, these westerners knowing too well that African leaders, politicians,\nretired Generals- big 'time Government contractors, civil servant (top most)\nall loot their treasuries and empty them into European banks, fall prey to\nphoney letters, prepared by fraudsters to send funds across to them. That is it\nMorgan, nothing more. The systems and styles are all in the Internet for all to\nread. So if you think I'm one of them then you need your head to be examined. I\nknow change isn't cheap, it will cost you a 'death to the old' in order to\nexperience a 'birth to the new' do recall your smear campaign on me at once. \n\nCOVERT TRANSFER OF FUNDS OUT OF AFRICA: \n\nIn as much as the scare of '419' is real, daily, millions of dollars are being\nferried off to foreign accounts by those that 'MATTER ACROSS AFRICA, leaders,\n(living or dead) such as the late President Mobutu Seseseku of former Zaire,\nlate Idi Amin of Uganda, late Gen. Sanni Abacha of Nigeria, President Eyadema\nof Togo, President Omar Bango of Gabon, etc are well known looters of their\nnations vaults. Current African leaders are currently very active in this\nfield. Members of the political class fully aware of this 'game' are not\nstanding idle. Plush homes in Paris, Switzerland, London, Los Angeles etc Golf\ncourses, amazing stocks in blue chip firms have all been taken over by Africans\nnouveau rich. \nNigeria is a front 'runner. Late Gen. Sanni Abacha, who died rollicking with\nprostitutes 'imported' from India stole about US $5.5billion in course of his\ngovernance between 1994- 1998. Quite often British Officials intercept big time\nMinisters of Government flying into London's Heathrow airport with brief case\nstuffed with cash funds ' up to $1million. On the other hand, Nigeria been a\nvery resourceful nation fall prey to Western Multi-National Firms who fall over\nthemselves to pay huge bribes for juicy contracts. The French Newspaper Le\nFigaro Parlier this year in Paris reported that a French judge Renaud Van\nRuymbeke has warned that the United States vice President Dick Cheney could be\nchanged over allegations that his former company Halliburton paid $180million\nin bribes to build the $4billion Nigeria liquefied Natural Gas plant in Bonny.\nVice 'President Cheney was head of Halliburton for 5 of the 7 years during\nwhich the secret payments were allegedly made. Prosecutors are also\ninvestigating a disclosure by Halliburton that an official of Kellogg Brown &\nRoot (Halliburton subsidiary) paid $2.4million bribe to a Nigerian official in\n2001 in the return for lower taxes. \nHere in Ghana, Ashanti Goldfields of Ghana bought over Anglogold of South\nAfrican to become the world's biggest gold producer. Monumental deals running\ninto millions of dollars took place to secure this seat. Anglogold Ashanti\nearlier this month announced that it has agreed to acquire a 30% stake in\ntrans-siberian gold (TSF) through an equity investment of about \u00a317.6million.\nThe company golds mining and exploration licences in respect of its three (3)\nexisting projects- Asacha, Rodnikovoe and Veduga ' as well as an exploration\nlicence over an extensive area surrounding veduga. Illegal exports of rough\ndiamonds from Congo, has been traced to the President of the Republic of Congo,\nby the CIA, Morgan, trade in illegal diamond sales anywhere in the world is\nworth billions of dollars. Arab fundamentalists and Arabian oil sheiks are\nflocking into Africa in droves to lodge huge oil proceed sales in African\nBanks. Although global anti-terrorist intelligence network is in operation in\nAfrica; it's not so effective to crack down these huge inflows. African Banks\nare upholding the 'secrecy acts' to the letter. \nMorgan, what about Russia? With communism dead, there are over 36billionaires in\nthe city of Moscow alone. Do you know how they make their money? Ukrainian born\nRussian billionaire Viktor Vekseiberg worth over $4billion earned over half of\nthis fortune from dealing in precious metals ' especially Diamond. He had\nstakes in some diamond mines in Liberia. He has visited Liberia in the past. \nWhat about Mikhail Khodonsky the Urbane, dashing 40 years old billionaire\nprincipal shareholder in Yukos currently in jail. He is awaiting trial over a\nplethora of charges ranging from tax fraud to embezzlements; there is of course\nElena Baturina. Her wealth is said to be derived from Inteko, a construction\ncompany. Is her husband Yuri Luzkkov (Mayor of the city of Moscow) not linked\nto her stupendous wealth? Do you know other deals they are engaged in? Yet,\nyour desire is to see 'Morgan LeFay' written in the public toilets of\nNovosibirsk! How lovely! In the words of George Farquhar ... Tis still my\nmaxim, that there is no scandal like rags, nor any crime so shameful as\npoverty...I suppose you are from a poor background hence the demand by your\nfather for a dowry payment of $45,000. Ukraine, your home country suffered a\nsevere famine in 1932/1933 under Joseph Stalin leading to the death of over 5\nmillion Ukrainians (like the Jews during the holocaust). During world war II it\nwas over run by the Axis armies in 1941 before being retaken by the soviets in\n1944. Sadly in 1986, it was the site of the worlds worst nuclear power plant\naccident- the Chernobyl disaster. Generations yet unborn will still bear the\nscars of deformity, a fall out of radio active and toxic effect of that\naccident. Its not a good history. Morgan, beware of malignant poverty and face\nrealities. \n\nMARRIAGE: \nYou made fun out of divorce experience. Well, thank God I've got 3 lovely kids.\nNo matter what, age 18, they'll be free to decide whom to live with. I have no\nregrets in separating with my ex-wife and your brazen lie of holding a\ntelephone talk with her makes you sick in the world's regard, wretched and low,\nacting like a poor unminded out law. Am I now regard your 'songs of love' to me\nas comfortless as frozen water to a starved snake ..' I'm for real Morgan and\nI'm proud of my pedigree. I can't tell about yours because you've failed to\nprove yourself and you're beginning to act like a loose canon. Its a shame; you\nare a disgrace to your family & or boss. Morgan, you are not married, your old\nfolks are worried, you have no child 'Biological or adopted, perhaps you're\nbasking in your demented state of beauty which is making you petulant. As a\nfather, I have found that I have a ministry of hugs. When something happens,\nand I really can't fix it, I just hug them ... can you share in this great\nexperience, no Morgan you can't. Each stage of life has its own challenges and\npotential. Somewhere ahead of me- in yet another stage is the smile of\ncontentment that I will display if I have handled this stage correctly. The\nhand of God is warm and tender, yet firm & strong. It is there for every dark\nnight, for every tainted secret and for every wounded marriage! God wipes away\nthe hidden tears we never allowed to fall. There are several beautiful black\ngirls in Ghana falling over to marry me, but I'm careful. \n\nI'm quite exposed and I've visited great European cities including Paris,\nMonte-Carlo, Geneva etc. After this project, I'll have good funds to pick a\nwife in any of these cities. But I'll still keep your picture because it tells\na 'great story' in future. The wedding rings are ready by now, on my return to\nAccra, I'll head back to the Cape Coast to pick them up. It's pure gold, whose\nhand it fits?. I'm not paying cash for it, but trading it with a farm land\ngiven to me by my mother. If your finger is not worth it, thousand of fingers\nare out there waiting. \n\nTHE DEPOSIT: \nTell Lewd the Bank has cancelled the beneficiary status extended to him over\nthe deposit- US$105m, he is no longer qualified to receive these funds and a\npower of attorney is thus required from him within 7 banking days, starting\nfrom July 20th 2004, transferring beneficiary status to Mr. David Shipler, Los\nAngeles California.
