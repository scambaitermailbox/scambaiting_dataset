Mr McBoll actually carries out his geek-threat, and he sends out thousands of death threat emails using my return address. My inbox and spam folder are temporarily flooded with \"undeliverable message\" replies, plus a few replies from real people who mostly want to inquire about the health and predilections of my mother. Their last names all start with the letter \"J\" - I think Mr McBoll could not afford the whole set of worldwide spammable email addresses. I sent out explanations to each of these persons, and pretty much everyone was sympathetic and friendly once the situation was explained to them The most difficult one was a lady who responded in French asking why I wanted to kill her. I could only respond, \"l'etat\u00c9. C'est moi!\n\nI figure at this point, the best strategy with the scammer is to pretend that his actions are having no effect, so I say nothing to him about it and instead follow up with:", "I wish Mr. McBoll had responded about the chipmunks, but obviously he had moved on to browner pastures. I received no further communication from my former partner, but his Joe-job did cause some genuine damage. \nFirst, I lost access to my Yahoo email account: I could no longer log in. When I contacted Yahoo they told me my account had been closed for violation of the terms of service. I explained the situation to them, i.e. that I was the victim, but to no avail. Yahoo does not seem to be interested in investigating each and every case, and just follows a blanket policy of cancelling any account that might be questionable. I cannot complain really, it is their nickel since my email account was free. I had owned this account for about 8 years, but it was my backup account that I used whenever I did not care about security. This is why it received the spam in the first place. \nSecond, a month later I received a phone call from a police officer in Florida, asking me if I was responsible for sending a death threat to an upright citizen in Humbolt County. \n\nI explained the situation, and the officer was very understanding and we had a nice conversation. Actually I don't mind this, since I think it provides information to the law authorities to understand these types of scams. I would not mind being contacted by some law enforcement agency that would be interested in setting one of these guys up. But I can also forsee being investigated by some law enforcement agency that might be more skeptical. If so, Mr. McBoll's could in fact succeed in hurting me. That would be quite an accomplishment - he would have beaten with nothing more than a few electrons. \n\n\n \t\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nscamorama main street \n* \nget booked \n*"], "messages": [{"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "", "author_role": "scam", "body": "Players\n, who sends a death threat to Joe Smith\n, who doesn't take it seriously until the chipmunks start dying", "raw": "<hr>\n<u>Players</u><br />\n<span class=\"mcboll\">Mc Boll</span>, who sends a death threat to Joe Smith<br />\n<span class=\"js\">Joe Smith</span>, who doesn't take it seriously until the chipmunks start dying\n</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "", "author_role": "scam", "body": "mc_boll@rocketmail.com\n\n\n\n \nExtremely Urgent Joe Smith,Wednesday, September 10, 2008 7:21 AM \n\n  \nHello Joe Smith, \n  \nListen, if you comply with me, you will not die.  \n  \nTo be specific, I am an assassin and one of the best today.
