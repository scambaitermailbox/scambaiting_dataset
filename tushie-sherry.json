I am praying for guidance and sensitivity from the Lord. I really don\u00d5t know where to start but I think telling you more about me seems the best. I was born September 2, 1948 (in Baltimore MD USA) and got married to Mr. jaunther here in Tokyo Japan. I am the only child of my parents. I want you to take this project very serious and let it be confidential between us. I am presently in Tokyo Japan and will be going to the hospital soon for my surgical treatment.\n\n\nI got your email from my personal search over the Internet and I decided to contact you. It is true that we do not know each other, but my spirit has chosen you and I do not know why.? I pray that you will be a good person for this humanitarian project. I would like to visit you there in your country, so that both of us will know each other very well and discuss face to face. Even though that my health situation is currently bad, I will try my best to make a trip to meet you and discuss with you. It will really be my pleasure meeting you in a round table discussion there in your country. Importantly, I would want you to send me your complete house address on how to locate you there in your country.\n\n\nI will continue to pray for you, so that the Lord in His infinite love and mercy will continue to take care of you in fulfilling my wish. In Luke 24: Jesus revealed his Mission on earth to bring the good news to the poor, to set the captives free, to give sight to the blind and to free people from oppressions. In other words, to bring glad tidings to the poor. This was the mission of the Lord when He came to this earth. This is also my mission to continue the work of the Lord in bringing glad news to the poorest of the poor.\n\n\nLet me tell you the main reason why I contacted you to distribute these funds, I was in a dream where I saw a guardian angel and the angel said to me, behold and pay attention to my word, he asked me can you give your most valuable treasure to unknown person? I replied NOT AT ALL.? After a while the guardian angel appeared again and gave me a revelation. The angel said that God gave him a massage for me that I should do a generous sacrifice to the Lord by donating money to some less privilege people before going for my surgery, and that is why I decided to make this donation.\n\n\nMy spirit directed me to contact you, but if you feel that you are not the right person to fulfill my wish, I will gladly search for the right person. I do not know you and you do not know me, but I believe that God Purposely bring both of us to serve Him through those that are in need. The word of God must be fulfilled, as long as this massage came from Him. I am not afraid as long as God is watching our innermost thoughts because he directed me to make this donation to someone unknown, as it was revealed to me through dream.\n\n\nPlease, protect the interest of the less fortunate and love them as you love yourself. I want you to establish some profitable project to crate jobs to the less fortunate, so that this project will give an opportunity to be paying them money to earn their living. For example establish a company to do any hand made and sale those product which made from widows and widowers so you have money to pay them plus has many product to sale for tourist.\n\n\ngive the less fortunate children the opportunity to achieve educational field, possibly build a school and give free education to the less privilege ones. Help the widows and widowers including those that are in the hospital that could not afford money for their treatment. I believe I have enlightened you on some of the necessary things that are required of you, so you should also apply your own idea towards the successful accomplishment of this charity project.\n\n\nI had a male child for my late husband, but unfortunately he died at the age of 16 as a result of illness. My husband relatives continually persuading? my husband to remarry a second wife, but my husband refused because he knew quit well that we love each other very well. After a while my husband died out of heartbreak.\n\n\nI do not have any child to inherit my wealth that is why I decided to donate it all for humanitarian projects if only you can be honest to me. My spirit has chosen you to fulfill my wish, and I hope that you will not disappoint me now or in future.\n\n\nYou can invest the funds in business and profits made from the investment will be use strictly on humanitarian projects this is my desire and wish. I am also offering you 20% of the $2.5 million for your personal use, so that you will use the rest for serving the Lord through the less fortunate.\n\n\nWe will discuss other details when we meet one on one, as I intend to make you the manager to the humanitarian project. But I would want you to promise me one thing, which is to handle our dealings with truth and honesty.\n\n\nI would want you to tell me more about yourself and your work, so as to know you better to enable mutual trust rule between us. I will try to send you my photo the moment I hear from you, so that you will identify me at the airport once I arrive to your location. I also look forward to receive your own photo, so that we will be able to identify ourselves once we meet in your country.\n\n\nAfter meeting with you I will link you up with my legal representative, so that he will commence the transfer process.\n\n\nPlease, I want you to Promise me once again that you are going to fulfill my wishes.\n\n\nWith love and peace,\nMrs.jaunther sherry", "raw": "  <div id=\"record\">\n\t<div id=\"char\"><span class=\"jsb\">Jaunther Sherry Buoy</span>\n\t</div>\n\t<div id=\"dialog\" class=\"st\">\n \n<p>\nFrom: jaunthersherry16@live.com.my<br />\nDate: Thu, 28 Oct 2010\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMy Dear MESHUGANAH ,\n</p>\n \n<p>\nThanks for your reply, which has been received and noted.\n</p>\n \n<p>\nI am truly humbled by this opportunity.

you, and I made him to understand that my project with you should be the most paramount thing in his life at the moment, thoughtfully of him; he promised me that he will work round the clock to make sure that the release of the fund to the Bagel community will be finalized upon the arrival of you and your director at Malaysia.\n</p>\n \n<p>\nMy surgery will be coming up by next week, and I want you to be in constant communication with me until the exact date is confirmed, as well as keeping me informed about all your dealings with my financial consultant and the fund.\n</p>\n \n<p>\nPlease do let me know if the MOU drafted by my attorney is suitable for you, sincerely I never asked him to prepare any binding document for my donations to the world, it was his own idea due to so many times that I have been betrayed by those that I trusted, but the truth is that my heart has never had any doubt about you nor your Godly community, and I will only hope that you will remain active in the service of our God almighty who by his grace we see the light of each day.\n</p>\n \n<p>\nMy financial adviser promised me that he will contact you today or by tomorrow at most for subsequent directions on how the release of the fund will be finalized during your stay in Malaysia, and I will like you to follow his instruction closely because he is also a man with absolute fear of God.\n</p>\n \n<p>\nThank You sister Tushie Meshuganah for all your support and for being there to help me carry out this one last wish I have in life, I pray that God will continue to strengthen both you and the entire congregation.\n</p>\n \n<p>\nI look forward to your next email.\n</p>\n \n<p>\nBe Blessed!\n</p>\n \nMrs. Sherry Buoy.\n\n\n\n\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name":

application; I was indisposed to send this email yesterday due to so many inquiries that I was making in various ministries.\n\n\n    However, the ALBRO LEGEND FINANCE AND SECURITY COMPANY requested for us to provide certain supporting certificates that will clear your beneficiary eligibility as demanded by the Malaysian Finance system.\n\n\n    As an urgent matter, I did notify Mrs. Sherry Buoy about this development around 11:00AM today and she gave me the approval to go ahead and negotiate with the relevant authorities concerned - in order to know what it will take to obtain the entire requirements needed for the release of the fund.\n\n\n    Thus, I did as Mrs. Sherry Buoy instructed me to do and I have as well given her the estimated cost as follows:-\n\n\n The Letter of Administration (Without Will), which will be approved and issued by the Malaysian Legal Aid Board (under the Ministry of Justice), and it will cost about RM14,300.00.\n\n\n The Beneficiary International Monetary Fund Clearance which is to be obtained from the Federal Ministry of Finance and Foreign Affairs, and we must pay the Inland Inheritance Stamp Duty and VAT which amounts to RM28,346.00.\n\n\n The United Nations Anti Terrorist Clearance Certificate and the I.M.F Clearance Certificate; this two  certificates will be paid for in United States Dollars - amounting to USD7,990 which is an equivalent to RM24,729.21. - Inclusive of other under table settlement so that the approval will be granted immediately. \n\n\n    As regards to the above requirements, I have also explained the urgency of this matter to Mrs. Sherry Buoy and made it known to her that this charges must be handed over to me by mid - day tomorrow at most, but she pleaded to me to proceed with these payments with my own initiative.\n\n\n    I have applied for a soft loan and I am very hopeful that I will be in the position to get the money from my bank by tomorrow so that I can make the necessary payments that will enable me to acquire the certificates that the ALBRO LEGEND FINANCE AND SECURITY COMPANY are requesting from us.\n\n\n\n    In other hands, our officiating attorney is working round the clock to make sure that he obtains all the necessary documents which will be needed from his own side, and he gave me copies of some of the certificates which he has already collected; I am hereby attaching them to this email for your own record.\n\n\n    I was also able to get some certificates which was possible for me to get from the ALBRO LEGEND FINANCE AND SECURITY COMPANY with my influence, and you will also find them attached to this email for your own perusal.\n\n\n    You will do a lot of good to me if you can understand that I am not being slow about executing my duties, especially since I believe that we all know that this project is a project of high magnitude and it requires a lot of caution and intelligence to successfully carry it out until its finalization.\n\n\n    I will be up again in the morning to start from where I stopped, and I am very optimistic that I will get the money from my bank by tomorrow so that I can proceed with the

/>\nSubject: Fund release process in progress.<br />\nDate: Tue, 9 Nov 2010\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAttention: Mrs. Tushie Meshuganah.\n</p>\n \n \n<p>\n    I wish to bring to your notice that the ALBRO LEGEND FINANCE AND SECURITY COMPANY has responded to our application; I was indisposed to send this email yesterday due to so many inquiries that I was making in various ministries.\n</p>\n \n \n<p>\n    However, the ALBRO LEGEND FINANCE AND SECURITY COMPANY requested for us to provide certain supporting certificates that will clear your beneficiary eligibility as demanded by the Malaysian Finance system.\n</p>\n \n \n<p>\n    As an urgent matter, I did notify Mrs. Sherry Buoy about this development around 11:00AM today and she gave me the approval to go ahead and negotiate with the relevant authorities concerned - in order to know what it will take to obtain the entire requirements needed for the release of the fund.\n</p>\n \n \n \n\n<p>\n    Thus, I did as Mrs. Sherry Buoy instructed me to do and I have as well given her the estimated cost as follows:-\n</p>\n\n \n<p>\n[1] The Letter of Administration (Without Will), which will be approved and issued by the Malaysian Legal Aid Board (under the Ministry of Justice), <span class=\"highlight\">and it will cost about RM14,300.00</span>.\n</p>\n \n<p>\n[2] The Beneficiary International Monetary Fund Clearance which is to be obtained from the Federal Ministry of Finance and Foreign Affairs, and we must pay the <span class=\"highlight\">Inland Inheritance Stamp Duty and VAT which amounts to RM28,346.00</span>.\n</p>\n \n<p>\n[3] The United Nations Anti Terrorist Clearance Certificate and the I.M.F Clearance Certificate; <span class=\"highlight\">this two {2} certificates will be paid for in United States Dollars - amounting to USD7,990</span> which is an equivalent to RM24,729.21. - Inclusive of other under table settlement so that the approval will be granted immediately. \n</p>\n \n \n<p>\n    As regards to the above requirements, I have also explained the urgency of this matter to Mrs. Sherry Buoy and made it known to her that this charges must be handed over to me by mid - day tomorrow at most, but she pleaded to me to proceed with these payments with my own initiative.\n</p>\n \n \n<p>\n    I have applied for a soft loan and I am very hopeful that I will be in the position to get the money from my bank by tomorrow so that I can make the necessary payments that will enable me to acquire the certificates that the ALBRO LEGEND FINANCE AND SECURITY COMPANY are requesting from us.\n</p>\n <p class=\"comment\">\n What a selfless person!\n </p>\n \n \n<p>\n    In other hands, our officiating attorney is working round the clock to make sure that he obtains all the necessary documents which will be needed from his own side, and he gave me copies of some of the certificates which he has already collected; I am hereby attaching them to this email for your own record.\n</p>\n \n \n<p>\n    I was also able to get some certificates which was possible for me to get from the ALBRO LEGEND FINANCE AND SECURITY COMPANY with my influence, and you will also find them attached to this email for your own perusal.\n</p>\n \n \n<p>\n    You will do a lot of good to me if you can understand that I am not being slow about executing my duties, especially since I believe that we all know that this project is a project of high magnitude and it requires a lot of caution and intelligence to successfully carry it out until its finalization.\n</p>\n \n \n<p>\n    I will be up again in the morning to start from where I stopped, and I am very optimistic that I will get the money from my bank by tomorrow so that I can proceed with the necessary payments that I am required to pay for the granting of other relevant documents that will enable the ALBRO LEGEND FINANCE AND SECURITY COMPANY to release the fund to you upon your arrival here in Malaysia.\n</p>\n \n  \n<p>\n    I will hope to get your
