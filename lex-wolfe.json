We inform you that No beneficiary or depositor has ever lost a penny of insured deposits since the DIF was created.\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\n\nIt was during our visit to the National Deposit Insurance Fund for Depositors/Investors (NDIF) to negotiate the release of funds of Outstanding-(unpaid-insurance-claim) owed to one of our clients that we stumbled across your file with the NDIF which we had to investigate. \n\n\nThis fund in the total sum of US9.256M USD only was held by the defunct Bank of Credit & Commerce International (BCCI). The Deposit Insurance Fund protects depositors' funds in the unlikely event of the financial failure of the paying bank.\n\n\nABOUT THE DEFUNCT BANK OF CREDIT & COMMERCE INTERNATIONAL:\nThe Bank of Credit & Commerce International (BCCI) was a major international bank founded in 1972 by Agha Hasan Abedi, a Pakistani financier. The Bank was registered in Ireland with head offices in Karachi and London. Within a decade BCCI touched its peak. It operated in 78 countries, had over 400 branches, and had assets in excess of US$20 billion, making it the 7th largest private bank in the world by assets. BCCI came under the scrutiny of numerous financial regulators and intelligence agencies in the 1980s due to concerns that it was poorly regulated. Subsequent investigations revealed that it was involved in massive money laundering and other financial crimes, and illegally gained controlling interest in a major American bank. BCCI became the focus of a massive regulatory battle in 2009 and on July 7 of that year, customs and bank regulators raided and locked down records of all branch offices of BCCI.\n\n\nWHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF NDIF DEPOSIT INSURANCE?\nThe NATIONAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE FUND FOR DEPOSITORS AND INVESTORS (NDIF) protects depositors' funds in the unlikely event of the financial failure of the paying bank. NDIF deposit insurance covers the total amount of each beneficiary\u00d5s fund, dollar-for-dollar, up to the insurance limit, through the date of the insured bank's closing.\n\n\nThere are over 400 billion dollars in unclaimed funds in Banks and securities, and this fund belongs to millions of people. Most people don't think or know they've lost money, but how do they really know unless they check? Lost money is money you don't know about, and that is precisely why we are contacting you!\n\n\nUnclaimed Funds subject to Article III of the Abandoned Properties/funds Law includes:\n? Bank accounts\n? Negotiable instruments\n? The contents of safe deposit boxes held for nonpayment of fees\n? Overpayment amounts and securities resulting from trust activities\n? Dormant trust customer accounts\n? Unclaimed securities found in a vault or storage area\n? Unclaimed amounts and securities resulting from paying agent and corporate trust activities \nincluding the issuance of American Depository Receipts (ADRs)\n? Capital stock of a banking organization\n? Lost property found on the premises of a safe deposit area of a bank or safe deposit company.\n\n\nRECORD RETENTION & CONFIRMATION:\nHaving identified you as one of the beneficiaries of the closed BCCI bank deposits, it might interest you to know that for the period from December 31, 2008 through July 07, 2009, a sum of 9.256,000.00 USD (Nine Million, Two Hundred and Fifty Six Thousand Dollars Only) as Inheritance Money was received by the Bank of Credit & Commerce International from the Bank of International Settlement. This fund was to be wired to your account as your entitlement. We understand BCCI was acting as the intermediary bank and while BCCI was waiting for Clearance from the Central Bank, the bank was closed. Verified information confirmed this fund has been kept in the strong room of the Central Bank of Ireland as an unclaimed property since July 2009 when BCCI was closed. It is the duty of the Deposit Insurance Fund to ensure that payments of insured deposits remitted to the banks are made to the beneficiaries of the closed banks without let or hindrance in accordance with Section 76.201 of the Unclaimed Property Code regarding unclaimed property.\n\n\nRe: INSURANCE STATEMENT RECONCILIATION AND PAYMENT PROCEDURE \nTo initiate your insurance settlement claim, you will be required to send an Application for Claim to the Deposit Insurance Fund for Depositors/Investors, addressed to the Policy Issuing Officer along with the below documents;\n\n\nDocuments that will be required to initiate claim:\n\n\n1. An application for claim, duly signed addressed to the Policy Issuing Officer, DIF. Attn: Cynthia Blaise; \n2. Scanned Photocopy of your Passport or Driving license or any other form of identification must be government issued.\n\n\nWhen you submit these documents, your payment process will be initiated through the office of the Policy issuing office. The procedures involved in processing unpaid closed BCCI bank deposits are not complicated and cumbersome, as many people perceive them to be. We will be monitoring your settlement process and to ensure your fund is paid without delay. \n\n\nAs a firm with wide range of legal skills and practical business knowledge, if you would want us to directly get involved in the settlement of your claim, we will be glad to be at your service & we will surely do our best to meet your needs.\n\n\nCould you kindly reply to this mail and indicate to us if you would prefer to deal directly with the Deposit Insurance Fund to request for settlement of your fund (we will immediately provide you the contact details of the Policy Issuing Officer, DIF. Attn: Cynthia Blaise) for you to contact her directly;\n\n\nOr would you want us to represent you as your fiduciary/representative and go for it on your behalf, to process the release of your funds?\n\n\nWe look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.\nYours faithfully,\n\n\nLarry Wolfe\nL.W.
