You will appreciate that my concern lays entirely in the personal welfare of Princess Candy, of whom I have nothing but the highest regard, as well as strict call to welfare duty. I am sure your attentions are honourable, and I would not want to spoil her happiness. But of course she is on the threshold of full woman hood, a blushing, pure flower of loveliness and she needs guidance and qualification in her romantic adventures. You know of course that she is heir to considerable landed estates in Smegaroon and royal Wankershire, while being 14th in line to the throne? This does indeed offer a real need for caution.\n\nShe being my ward, I naturally wish to follow each step of any possible connection between the two of you very closely indeed, to ensure that every element is beyond reproach. You must assure me that you are clean of habit and reputation, untainted by any personal adventure with woman of a loose kind and with unimpeachable vimtos. Perhaps you would do me the favour of sending me an image of yourself so that we can a basic judge or breeding and character? If you have beetle brows or a moose jaw, defiling our line, then that won't do at all, I am afraid.\n\nYou mention Princess Margaret. Have you in contact with her? Also I am not sure about the internet.

You will appreciate that my concern lays entirely in the personal welfare of Princess Candy, of whom I have nothing but the highest regard, as well as strict call to welfare duty. I am sure your attentions are honourable, and I would not want to spoil her happiness. But of course she is on the threshold of full woman hood, a blushing, pure flower of loveliness and she needs guidance and qualification in her romantic adventures. You know of course that she is heir to considerable landed estates in Smegaroon and royal Wankershire, while being 14th in line to the throne? This does indeed offer a real need for caution.\n<br><br>\nShe being my ward, I naturally wish to follow each step of any possible connection between the two of you very closely indeed, to ensure that every element is beyond reproach. You must assure me that you are clean of habit and reputation, untainted by any personal adventure with woman of a loose kind and with unimpeachable vimtos. Perhaps you would do me the favour of sending me an image of yourself so that we can a basic judge or breeding and character?

However we will still require a reliable inside leg and shoulder width to begin a preliminary cutting. Kindly make every effort to get information to us as any delay will eventually effect the time it takes to send you a first fitting. As you seem uncertain as to the best cut for yourself I append the following:,\n\nInternational Styles & Cuts,\n\nThe English style seems to be the most popular of all the schools of suit fashion, showing careful attention to detail. The jacket lies close to the body and is marked at the waist. The shoulders are soft, have little padding, and are not particularly large. The armholes are usually cut quite high. The English suit includes two side vents, even in dress suits. The double breasted jacket is more popular in England than in America where they prefer a two or three button single-breasted version, and the trousers usually have two pleats with the pockets placed along the seams.\n,\nThe Italians prefer the shoulder to be quite high, padded and to sag just a bit. The jacket clings a bit more tightly to the body and has a rather narrow armhole. The jackets generally have pockets without flaps and are without vents in the back. In Italy, single or double vents are often limited to sports jackets. The Italian pants have diagonally cut pockets and a low waist, probably because the Italians do not favor wearing suspenders or vests with their close fitted suit jackets.\n,\nIn America, the shoulder is more naturally soft, with an even slope and with little or no padding. Jackets almost always have three buttons, with only the center button fastened. The armholes are wider than the English version, thus providing more comfort and adaptability to different physiques. The pockets of the jacket have flaps, and the back has only one vent. The pants usually have no pleats and the fit down the leg is close.,\n\nThe French school comes from the style begun in the 1960's by Pierre Cardin, who designed a jacket with high shoulders and a visible little roll in the sleeve's head. This jacket is flared and very long, popular in England in the first half of the 20th century. Cardin's pants were bell-bottomed and without pleats.,\n\nThe German suits have always been designed for comfort and durability. The shoulder of the jacket is low and natural. The chest is prominent, providing enough room on the inside for pockets to hold wallets, notebooks, pens, etc. The pants crotch and waist are low.,\n\nThe Sabatini style is a mix between all the fashion schools. He suggests that men should concentrate on the executive single breasted, two-button style suit with a notched lapel and a medium fitted waist. The armhole should be 3/4\u00a5 deeper than the English style, for comfort. Opt for a medium fit shoulder. The collar of the jacket should lie close to the neck and the lapel should fit the contours of the chest. Make sure the inside canvas is of medium weight; if the canvas is too heavy, your jacket will be stiff. On the other hand a too light canvas will not work in the heat and humidity of summer. Your jacket will have no body and will appear wrinkled and worn.\n\nThe proper executive style suit jacket will have no vents or maybe one, if you are tall and thin. The no-vent jacket is especially important for men who are a little heavy in the seat. These men should absolutely stay away from side vents. The jacket should contain two outside convertible flap pockets (This allows you the freedom to use the flaps or fold them inside the pocket) and enough inside pockets to hold your pocket computer, pens, cell phone, and change. The sleeves will have four buttons with open, working buttonholes.,\n\nChoose the finest quality fabric you can afford and your suit will last you 15 years or longer, none of your native workmanship here! 100% woven wool is best for year-round wear. Wool is a natural fiber and breathes so you can be comfortable, even in very warm weather. You won't have to have a fine wool suit dry-cleaned very often if you hang it in the evening after wearing it. The wrinkles will fall out by morning and you can usually spot-clean wool with a little water.\n,\n**** SIR IN ADDITION I HAVE TAKEN THE LIBERTY TO ATTACH A FEW SAMPLES_INCLUDING ONE OF THE AS I UNDERSTAND IT TRADITIONAL NATIVE FABRIC STYLE_ FOR YOUR PERUSAL AND SELECTION.

However without wishing to revisit old problems, it may be worth reminding you that your own hesitations have contributed to the slow state of affairs in this matter. Candice has a couple of times felt that your hearts wishes were not entirely in turn with her own and felt considerably disillusioned with this matter. I understand that at times she even felt her ongoing interest in night clubbing had suffered through the distraction of not knowing what to expect and if you were genuine. To be frank, she is of an age where fervent, girlish emotions still rule her head. This of course makes an early marriage agreement to a husband of required standing, where such things may put aside in the cause of raising family and other womanly duties, all the more imperative.\n\nYou will know that, with HRH's agreement, things are now once again on the move. The next step will be for you to complete the paperwork due to be sent out by Sir Michaels office (I take the liberty of copying him in to this message, I know it is the Gooliepully Sheep Trials this week and this reminder will be timely) We look to concluding this element of the nuptials as soon as possible.

Candice has a couple of times felt that your heart\u001as wishes were not entirely in turn with her own and felt considerably disillusioned with this matter. I understand that at times she even felt her ongoing interest in night clubbing had suffered through the distraction of not knowing what to expect and if you were genuine. To be frank, she is of an age where fervent, girlish emotions still rule her head.
