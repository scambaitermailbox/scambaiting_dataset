Ruff asked them what they needed the money\nfor? They told him the barest details of our deal, and Mr. Ruff started to\nlaugh. At that point, he called his secretary, Miss J. Garland, over and asked\nher to provide John and Harley with some literature about Nigerian advance-fee\nfrauds. He called them \"419-scams\", and showed the boys several examples of how\nthese scammers work. The more he told John and Harley, the madder they got. <br><br>\n\nJohn and Harley were so angry about nearly being swindled, that they started\nyelling, and throwing things around the bank! Before they knew what was\nhappening, the secretary Miss Judy called the local police, and the Davidson\ntwins got carted off to jail. I had to post bail for them, and appear in court\non their behalf. <br><br>\n\nWhen my wife Sally Jean heard about it, she got really upset with me for being\nso gullible, but she was glad that I didn't put up any of our money. I don't\nthink she will ever let me forget about this episode. <br><br>\n\nThis, of course, is the end of our \"deal\". <br><br>\n\nRich Lather <br><br>\n<br><br>\n\n<a name=\"dec1\">\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "2004-11-30 13:54", "subject": "", "author_role": "scam", "body": "X-Originating-Ip: 81.132.3.191 \n\n\n\nHello Mr Lather,\n\nI hope this mail mets you in good condition as i have not heard from you for\nsometime as i recall you were surposed to get back to me ragerding the fees.I\nwill be most appreciative if you can get back to me thanks.\n\nSincerely,\n\nIgho", "raw": "<hr><font face=\"Georgia,Arial,Verdana\"><b><font color=\"brown\"><i>IGHO WILLIAMS</i></font></b> <br><br>\n\nX-Originating-Ip: 81.132.3.191 <-- British Telecom dial-up<br>\n\nDate: Tue, 30 Nov 2004 13:54:46 <br>\n<br>\n\nHello Mr Lather,<br><br>\n\nI hope this mail mets you in good condition as i have not heard from you for\nsometime as i recall you were surposed to get back to me ragerding the fees.I\nwill be most appreciative if you can get back to me thanks.\n<br><br>\nSincerely,\n<br><br>\nIgho\n<br><br>\n\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "", "author_role": "scam", "body": "Igho Williams,\n\nNaturally, in light of recent developments, there obviously will be no money\ncoming to you.\n\nI've finally got the Davidson boys out of jail.
