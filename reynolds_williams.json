Having explained these, you will agree with me therefore, that you need to pay the US$2800 to enable us process the approvals. <br />\nIf you are resident in Cotonou or within the west African region, I would have invited you to come to my office with the above stated processing amount, but since you are not residing in Cotonou, please find a means that is safe for you to send the money to me, so that , I can personally ensure that the procedure is done, by sending one of my staff to handle this matter so that by the time he  gets the necessary papers from the High Court, it will be brought to me for endorsement. <br />\nThis way, you will have a one-shut efective result, which is the probate approval for transfer of the funds to your account and immediate remittance of the funds by the order of the Probate Mandamus release order to the concerned bank.<br />\nNote that this is the only and final requirement for the probate approval, release of the funds for immediate transfer of the deposit to your designated account . You are however advised to write an official application to this office for the Probate approval. The Application should be addressed as follows:<br />\nATTEN: MR.
