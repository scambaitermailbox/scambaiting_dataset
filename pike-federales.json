How will he get the documents to me? Will your attorney be calling me? Does your attorney know about the money in the trunk box? When will your attorney want me to go to Holland? What is the address of the security company in Holland? Can you have your attorney call me on Monday?\n\nIf your attorney calls me, he MUST use the codephrase NO TENGO COJONES. You have no idea how important that codephrase is to the success of our operation. Your attorney must PRONOUNCE the codephrase PROPERLY, or HE WILL NOT GET THROUGH.\n\nPlease tell your attorney that the codephrase is pronounced, NO TENGO CO-HO-NEES.\n\nThe secretary who answered the phone in my office here last Friday is no longer working for me. He is now working for James T Kirk, who is making him wear a red shirt. I don't think he will be working for James T Kirk for very long. Serves that son of a bitch right.\n\nIt's too bad that your boss will not allow you to travel. I think your boss is a son of a bitch. I think you need to go to your boss, slap him in the face, and call him a son of a bitch. You won't need your job very much longer, as we will all have lots of money soon. I don't think you have anything to lose by doing this.\n\nIf you don't want to call your boss a son of a bitch, then please email me his telephone number, and I will call him a son of a bitch. I'll leave your name out of it. I have a feeling that your boss is too stupid to be using a codephrase that's designed to keep unwanted calls from reaching him. Email me his phone number, and I'll call him up and tell him he's a son of a bitch.\n\nWe used to have a guy around here named Trip Tucker, who said \"son of a bitch\" a lot. He even went on television a few times to say \"son of a bitch\". That was before I was working here; back when Jonathan Archer was sitting in what is now my chair. I've been told by my friends and co-workers that I say \"son of a bitch\" a lot, but I'm not sure I believe them. I think anybody who thinks that is a son of a bitch.\n\nAnyway, I got off the subject.\n\nPlease have your attorney call me on Monday. If your attorney does not get through, please have him keep trying. He MUST use the codephrase or he will NOT get through.\n\nI have to leave for Talos IV this afternoon to go rescue that ship that got lost. I think that all will go well, these things are usually routine. I'm taking some good people with me, such as Jose Tyler and this promising Lieutenant named Spock. I don't need a bunch of goons wearing red shirts to protect me like that fraidy-cat James T Kirk does. Maybe I should let that son of a bitch have my job. I'm starting to get sick of things as they are.\n\nOne last thing. You do not need to type in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS in your emails to me. It's a bit annoying when you do that. You should only use CAPITAL LETTERS for the IMPORTANT parts, such as the codephrase NO TENGO COJONES, for example.\n\nThanks very much, my friend and brother, for all of your hard work in this.

I don't need a bunch of goons wearing red shirts to protect me like that fraidy-cat James T Kirk does. Maybe I should let that son of a bitch have my job. I'm starting to get sick of things as they are.<br><br>\n\nOne last thing. You do not need to type in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS in your emails to me. It's a bit annoying when you do that. You should only use CAPITAL LETTERS for the IMPORTANT parts, such as the codephrase NO TENGO COJONES, for example.<br><br>\n\nThanks very much, my friend and brother, for all of your hard work in this.

It was quite the trip too.\n\nOn the way over there, my chief medical officer came to my quarters and served up some drinks. I think it was Antarian brandy or maybe it was Romulan ale.....I can't remember now. We get plenty of good tequila here in Tijuana, and whatever it was that Doctor Philip Boyce served was real smooth. He wanted to know what was on my mind. No, I didn't tell him about the trunk box, but I did tell him that I was thinking of resigning my commission and going into some other kind of business. I don't think he wants to see me leave.\n\nWhen we got to Talos IV, the rescue did not turn out the way I was hoping. There was only one survivor, a lady who was horribly disfigured from this ghastly crash. My boss, Commodore Mendez, wants the details of our operation there kept under wraps. He says he'll shoot anyone who goes back to Talos IV. I wouldn't go back anyway, I kept having all of these wierd delusions the entire time I was there.\n\nOne thing of note was that I was really impressed by my crew. I did catch Lieutenant Spock grinning stupidly when he was touching some flowers. I took him aside after that and told him to knock it off. Ever since then, he hasn't smiled or shown any emotion. He's a real logical person, and aside from that flower incident I think he's going to move up in the ranks, and make Captain one day. For right now it's best that he becomes a science officer, and I think he'll also be able to be what's called \"First Officer\" in addition. We'll give him a few years.

I really think that we should be using my attorney.\n\nIf your attorney can not so much as write email properly, then we should get rid of him and use someone else. If your attorney is having problems understanding me, then have him give me a call so that I can explain things.\n\nI think your attorney should give me a call anyway.

I may need your help in this. I might have you call Commodore Mendez, and use another codephrase. If I pick the right codephrase, Commodore Mendez will then think that the Klingons are after him and are not after me. It will take me some time to figure out which codephrase to use, as that he has several. There is one codephrase that if used, is a coded message from headquarters that warns of danger, and that will draw attention away from me. I need to find out what that codephrase is, but I will have to get back to my office in Tijuana so that I can look it up. Fortunately, I have access to the secret file that lists all of the codephrases.\n\nI know this sounds complicated, but in your first message, you said you were involved in paramilitary operations, so hopefully you have an appreciation of the elaborate security measures that we must sometimes take. I feel that it is important that we use them for getting this trunk box out of Holland....that's why I gave you a codephrase, one that people who need to talk to me will need in order to get through to me.\n\nRight now I am extremely disappointed in your attorney.

plan on how to get to Holland.\n\nFirst, Commodore Mendez must think that an attempt will be made on his life. In order for that to happen, he will have to get a call with a special codephrase. That codephrase will be an order from headquarters that tells Commodore Mendez that the Klingons are after him, and he is to leave the office and to take refuge in a safe house. When this call arrives, the secretary will immediately drop the phone.\n\nNext, the secretary will wait for confirmation of the order. That means that you must call again with the codephrase....at that point, the secretary will know that the order is genuine. The secretary will not answer you....he will drop the phone as before.\n\nThe more calls that the secretary gets with this new codephrase, the more serious the threat is to Commodore Mendez, and the more likely he will leave Tijuana. I recommend that you call at least six times, but if you can call twenty times that would be even better.\n\nSince I am the ranking officer in his absence, Commodore Mendez will then place me in charge, and at that point I will be able to arrange travel to Holland.\n\nOne important note: I do not ever want your attorney to call me ever again. If he does, then this deal is OFF and you will have to find another partner to help you with the trunk box. Your attorney can communicate with me via email.\n\nPlease let me know if you are willing to make these calls to Commodore Mendez.\n\nBy the way, the security team here has investigated the calls that your attorney made. They were traced to Lagos, Nigeria. How is it that your attorney, who is in the Congo, was in Nigeria?\n\nbest regards,\n\nCaptain Christopher Pike", "raw": "<hr><b><font color=\"green\">Captain Christopher Pike</font></b><br><br>\n\nDate:\n\nMon, 1 Dec 2003 11:18:15 -0800 (PST)<br>\n\n<br>\n\nDear Mr. Isaac,<br>\n\nTENGO GRAVITAS<br><br>\n\nI have returned to my office in Tijuana, and I am glad to be back.<br>\n\nHere is my plan on how to get to Holland.<br>\n\nFirst, Commodore Mendez must think that an attempt will be made on his life.

I hope that your family will have strength to guide them as they mourn their loss.\n\nNow I need to pass along the new CODEPHRASE that will warn Commodore Mendez that his life is in danger from the Klingons.\n\nIt is: TENGO CHICHIS MUCHAS GRANDES. It is Spanish for \"dancing (in) very grand clothes\", but when they hear it used here it's a warning to Commodore Mendez that he must leave Tijuana at the earliest opportunity.\n\nI now need to teach you how to pronounce this.\n\nAs you already know, TENGO is pronounced as it looks....TEN and GO....TENGO\n\nCHICHIS is pronounced CHEE CHEES. You have no doubt heard of the cheetah....the \"CHI\" in Spanish is pronounced \"CHEE\", like \"cheetah\", or \"cheese\". CHICHIS, when pronounced, becomes CHEE-CHEESE.\n\nNext we have MUCHAS. It's related to the English word \"much\", but in Spanish has the meaning more like \"very\". MUCHAS is pronounced MOO-CHAS. MOO rhymes with the English word \"DO\"....CHAS will rhyme with the English word \"WAS\".\n\nNow it's on to GRANDES.....related to the English word \"grand\", but pronounced somewhat differently. You would pronounce it \"GRAHN-DAYS\". \"GRAHN\" rhymes with the English word \"CON\". \"DAYS\" in GRANDES is pronounced of course, \"DAYS\".\n\nPut this all together, and you get TENGO CHEECHEESE MOOCHAS GRAHNDAYS.\n\nIt's too bad that there aren't any Spanish ladies in the Congo who could help you with the codephrases. I'm sure that if you were to say \"TENGO CHICHIS MUCHAS GRANDES\" to her, that she would definitely smile at you......some Spanish ladies might think that they \"TENGO CHICHIS MUCHAS GRANDES\", but most of them already know that, and besides that's not something that they would have to tell anybody....that can be visually established in most cases. I'm sure that many men would enjoy dancing with a Spanish lady who can say \"TENGO CHICHIS MUCHAS GRANDES\".\n\nAgain, the CODEPHRASE for Commodore Mendez is TENGO CHEECHEESE MOOCHAS GRAHNDAYS. I'm sure you can handle that.\n\nAs for when you call, the office is open 24 hours per day. It's best to wait until it's evening in Africa, so that it will be daylight in Mexico.\n\nIt is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT that you call at least SIX times. Each time, the secretary will drop the phone, but they will expect more than one call. More than one phone call will confirm that the order for Commodore Mendez is real, and the more calls there are then the more serious the threat is to him. The secretary will NOT say anything, as that a call of this nature is something they've never heard before, and they would probably be more interested in dropping the phone so that they can report the call to the commanding officer.\n\nIf you can call twenty times that would be great, but I'll leave that up to you.\n\nAfter you make the calls, please email me to let me know how it went at your end. Please also tell me how many times you called.\n\nAs for the calls your attorney made, I think it's a good thing that the security team here believes that they are from Nigeria. That would draw attention away from the Congo, and from Holland. Maybe Nigeria is the point where the call left Africa to enter Mexico. I don't know how the phone system works, but I know of this Lieutenant Uhura here who could explain it all to me. It's a wonder that James Kirk hasn't hit up on her, I understand that she dances in grand clothes, if you get my drift.....though it's more likely he's after this yeoman named Janice Rand.....\n\nMy brother.....we are almost ready to execute the transaction!

He is insisting that I take some bodyguards with me, but that won't be a problem. The bodyguards have no idea why I'm going, and I don't tell them anything anyway. They think that a secret mission is coming up.

I looked at the certificate of deposit that your attorney sent me, and the security company has already been paid $58,100 in fees. If any problems arise with the demurrage, I will get my attorney to help out with that....he's an expert in international law, security, and operations, and he'll be a valuable help to us if the need arises. I keep telling you that we need to fire your attorney and use mine instead, and if your attorney makes one more mistake then we'll get rid of him and use mine.....especially if those bastards at the security company want any money.\n\nI am right now looking into available flights.....I will let your attorney know just when I will be in Holland. It might be difficult to find a flight since Christmas is almost upon us, but I do have the option of flying over in a military jet or a shuttlecraft, if I have to. I might also look into using our transporter. Captain Kirk's medical officer doesn't like the transporter, Captain Archer and his people never thought that much of it, but that would be available if all else fails.\n\nYour attorney will hear from me once I have the flights and hotel arranged.\n\nIn the meantime, thank you again for your help and for your phone calls.\n\nIf you need to talk to me, make sure that you use the codephrase NO TENGO COJONES if you call me on the phone. People at the office here in Tijuana are a little nervous about security right now. The secretary who took your calls never heard that codephrase before, but he knew what it meant....and he handled your calls in a most appropriate manner. I can guarantee you that he will never forget what happened.\n\nWe're almost there.......have confidence!

A lot of changes have\ntaken place at my end, and I can't tell you how excited I am about this New\nYear.  \n\nFirst, I've been promoted to Fleet Captain! I never heard of that rank before,\nbut I guess I'm now Commodore Mendez's right hand man. I'll be hanging around\nthe office a whole lot more than I used to, but I might have to train some\ncadets here and there. I've gotten word that I need to take some of them out on\nthe USS Republic, and as far as I know that will happen right around the 13th. \n \nThe promotion though, comes with mixed feelings.....James Kirk finally got what\nhe wanted, command of my ship. He's now a Captain, and he promoted Spock to\nLieutenant Commander and made him First Officer. My First Officer now has a job\ndoing computer voice-overs, and I hear that she's going to be the head nurse on\nJim Kirk's ship. I don't know why she would want to do that......Captain Kirk\nmight grope her (if he isn't groping Janice Rand), but it won't do him any\ngood.....I hear that she's got the hots for Mr. Spock.\n \nI'm really hearing some crazy stories now about Captain Kirk and his crew. Just\nlast week they were at some frozen science station, and when they got back on\nboard, this guy named Joe Tormolen stabbed himself to death in the cafeteria!\nThen this guy named Sulu went crazy, and started chasing everybody with a\nsword. I even heard that Spock broke down in a crying fit....first time he\nshowed any emotion since I caught him grinning at the flowers back on Talos IV.\nHell, I still can't believe that Joe Tormolen killed himself with a kitchen\nknife.....poor guy wasn't even wearing a red shirt!\n \nOK. Now about Holland. I'll be arriving in Amsterdamn in a couple of weeks.\nUnless the schedule changes, I'll be at the Security Company office at 2:00 PM\non Friday, the 16th of January. I still have to do that training mission for\nthe Republic, and once that wraps up I'll leave Tijuana, and get over to\nAmsterdamn to get that trunk box for you. We expect the training mission to end\nthat week. \n\nI'm sorry I can't do this earlier, but this training mission is something that\nCommodore Mendez would really like to see me do. In a way, I'm looking forward\nto working with these up-and-coming trainees.....I have this feeling that I\nshould check the baffle plate on that ship though.\n \nI really don't think that you need to call me right now.

A lot of changes have\ntaken place at my end, and I can't tell you how excited I am about this New\nYear.  <br><br>\n\nFirst, I've been promoted to Fleet Captain! I never heard of that rank before,\nbut I guess I'm now Commodore Mendez's right hand man. I'll be hanging around\nthe office a whole lot more than I used to, but I might have to train some\ncadets here and there. I've gotten word that I need to take some of them out on\nthe USS Republic, and as far as I know that will happen right around the 13th. \n <br><br>\nThe promotion though, comes with mixed feelings.....James Kirk finally got what\nhe wanted, command of my ship. He's now a Captain, and he promoted Spock to\nLieutenant Commander and made him First Officer. My First Officer now has a job\ndoing computer voice-overs, and I hear that she's going to be the head nurse on\nJim Kirk's ship. I don't know why she would want to do that......Captain Kirk\nmight grope her (if he isn't groping Janice Rand), but it won't do him any\ngood.....I hear that she's got the hots for Mr. Spock.\n <br><br>\nI'm really hearing some crazy stories now about Captain Kirk and his crew. Just\nlast week they were at some frozen science station, and when they got back on\nboard, this guy named Joe Tormolen stabbed himself to death in the cafeteria!\nThen this guy named Sulu went crazy, and started chasing everybody with a\nsword. I even heard that Spock broke down in a crying fit....first time he\nshowed any emotion since I caught him grinning at the flowers back on Talos IV.\nHell, I still can't believe that Joe Tormolen killed himself with a kitchen\nknife.....poor guy wasn't even wearing a red shirt!\n <br><br>\nOK. Now about Holland. I'll be arriving in Amsterdamn in a couple of weeks.\nUnless the schedule changes, I'll be at the Security Company office at 2:00 PM\non Friday, the 16th of January. I still have to do that training mission for\nthe Republic, and once that wraps up I'll leave Tijuana, and get over to\nAmsterdamn to get that trunk box for you. We expect the training mission to end\nthat week. <br><br>\n\nI'm sorry I can't do this earlier, but this training mission is something that\nCommodore Mendez would really like to see me do. In a way, I'm looking forward\nto working with these up-and-coming trainees.....I have this feeling that I\nshould check the baffle plate on that ship though.\n <br><br>\nI really don't think that you need to call me right now. Everything is under\ncontrol. Plus, you keep having bad luck when you try to call. But if you really\nwant to talk to me, let me know, and we'll schedule a time.

You have this (TRUNK BOX) with $20\nmillion dollars in it, and your attorney says that this (TRUNK BOX) is small. I\ndon't get it. That's a lot of money to be carrying around, and I don't see how\nyou can fit this much cash inside of a small (TRUNK BOX). I checked out the\ncatalog of the Drinkwater Trading Company to look at their pictures of (TRUNK\nBOX)es, and those things are heavy sons of bitches! I'll need at least six men\nto help me carry one of these, and your attorney is telling me not to bring\nthem!  \n\nAnyway, I now figured out what to do with this (TRUNK BOX). Right after we get\nit, we'll take it down to the Congo for you. As soon as we pick it up, we can\nbeam on down to the Congo and deliver it straight to your house. All you need\nto do is tell me where your house is.....I don't think you understand how our\ncoordinate system works, but if you send me your street address we'll figure\nout how to get there. We can be there that same Friday night if you wish, but\nyou'll probably want to go out dancing with ladies who dance in very grand\nclothes instead. I don't blame you. I'd rather be doing that myself.  \n\nOnce we get this to your house, we'll divvy up the money. I can have my men\nhelp you transport this money to Mexico if you wish. I'll make them ditch the\nred shirts if that will make you feel better. And when we get to Mexico, you\ncan do one of two things. You can retire, and tell the ladies there that you\ndon't dance inside, or I can talk to Commodore Mendez about giving you a job.\nPlease note that if Commodore Mendez gives you a job, do not let him assign you\nto Captain Kirk. If Captain Kirk gets ahold of you, he'll make you wear a red\nshirt, take you somewhere, and then you'll never be heard from again. \n \nNow about your phone call tomorrow. Please make sure that you use the\nCODEPHRASE. The codephrase is NO TENGO COJONES. Yeoman Colt is scheduled to be\nmy secretary on duty, and I'll let her know that a CODEPHRASE call is coming\nin.

But\nat least you follow instructions, and you're the only one that I trust right\nnow. I will be expecting your call, and if you have problems getting through,\nplease keep trying.  \n\nJust between you and me, they have this strange zoo back on Talos IV with all\nof these weird animals.

We have a hard\nenough time getting hold of Romulan ale here, I don't know how the hell you\npeople in Africa are able to get it.  <br><br>\n\nIs your attorney a member of the Congolese HonkyTonk Bar Association? That\nmight explain things if he is.  <br><br>\n\nAnyway, here is what is happening.  <br><br>\n\nI am arriving in the office of the security company in Amsterdamn at 2:00 PM,\non Friday the 16th of January. All of the arrangements have been made. I will\ncall the director once I arrive in Amsterdamn, and then I show up at the office\nand pick up the (TRUNK BOX). \n <br><br>\nNow here's something I don't understand. You have this (TRUNK BOX) with $20\nmillion dollars in it, and your attorney says that this (TRUNK BOX) is small. I\ndon't get it. That's a lot of money to be carrying around, and I don't see how\nyou can fit this much cash inside of a small (TRUNK BOX). I checked out the\ncatalog of the Drinkwater Trading Company to look at their pictures of (TRUNK\nBOX)es, and those things are heavy sons of bitches! I'll need at least six men\nto help me carry one of these, and your attorney is telling me not to bring\nthem!  <br><br>\n\nAnyway, I now figured out what to do with this (TRUNK BOX). Right after we get\nit, we'll take it down to the Congo for you. As soon as we pick it up, we can\nbeam on down to the Congo and deliver it straight to your house. All you need\nto do is tell me where your house is.....I don't think you understand how our\ncoordinate system works, but if you send me your street address we'll figure\nout how to get there. We can be there that same Friday night if you wish, but\nyou'll probably want to go out dancing with ladies who dance in very grand\nclothes instead. I don't blame you. I'd rather be doing that myself.  <br><br>\n\nOnce we get this to your house, we'll divvy up the money. I can have my men\nhelp you transport this money to Mexico if you wish. I'll make them ditch the\nred shirts if that will make you feel better. And when we get to Mexico, you\ncan do one of two things. You can retire, and tell the ladies there that you\ndon't dance inside, or I can talk to Commodore Mendez about giving you a job.\nPlease note that if Commodore Mendez gives you a job, do not let him assign you\nto Captain Kirk. If Captain Kirk gets ahold of you, he'll make you wear a red\nshirt, take you somewhere, and then you'll never be heard from again. \n <br><br>\nNow about your phone call tomorrow. Please make sure that you use the\nCODEPHRASE. The codephrase is NO TENGO COJONES. Yeoman Colt is scheduled to be\nmy secretary on duty, and I'll let her know that a CODEPHRASE call is coming\nin. If she isn't there, the substitute secretary will still know what to do\nwith a CODEPHRASE call. You absolutely, positively, MUST USE THE CODEPHRASE or\nyour call WILL NOT GO THROUGH.  <br><br>\n\nI really rather you didn't call, as that you don't have the best of luck. But\nat least you follow instructions, and you're the only one that I trust right\nnow. I will be expecting your call, and if you have problems getting through,\nplease keep trying.  <br><br>\n\nJust between you and me, they have this strange zoo back on Talos IV with all\nof these weird animals. I think we should take your attorney there.  <br><br>\n\nbest  regards,<br>\n\nCaptain Pike <br><br>\n\n\n[NOTE to readers: the reference to the Drinkwater Trading Company is my way of\nacknowledging the anti-scamming efforts of fellow scambaiter \"J. Dog\", who\nactually has set up a website where he has created a fictitious company that\nhandles offshore investments. He also had a web page with photos of trunk\nboxes. I wish there was a way that I could meet him in person, to share some\nRomulan ale.but for security reasons we scambaiters do not know each others\ntrue identities or locations.]<br><br>\n\n",

We also heard that\nCaptain Kirk was hanging around some gangsters, trying to cheat them in a card\ngame called fizzbin! \n \nWe've also got some questions about his new navigator, Ensign Chekov. We're\nwondering about him too. Turns out that Ensign Chekov took Lieutenant Uhura out\non a date, where he bought her a pet called a \"tribble\". It really isn't good\nform for crewmembers to be dating one another....then again, since Captain Kirk\ngropes Janice Rand every time someone launches a torpedo, what else can you\nexpect? We've also heard that Chekov screams a lot.....a group of six Klingons\nrecently grabbed Chekov. Two of them held him, while a third took a Norelco\nelectric razor and started shaving Chekov! Chekov screamed quite a bit.....I\ndon't know how familiar you are with Norelco razors or if you even have them in\nthe Congo, but there's no way they're going to hurt you. We're really getting\ndisturbed at Chekov for screaming when they did that to him. There's also this\none story of Chekov screaming when he saw this corpse on display\nsomewhere....he came running out of the room screaming. Hell, it was a\n corpse of someone who died of old age.....maybe prematurely, but old age\nnonetheless. \n\nMaybe we shouldn't worry about Chekov. I don't know. Captain Kirk has had\ntrouble with navigators. Lieutenant Bailey left to take a job serving as a\nrepresentative to the First Federation. Lieutenant Stiles didn't like Spock\nbecause Spock was \"different\". (I could explain that, but I won't.....you\nwouldn't believe his ears if I did....) Lieutenant Riley had these delusions\nabout being Captain while Sulu was chasing people with the sword, and he didn't\nlast long after that. If Ensign Chekov is going to stay a while, maybe we\nshould look the other way when he screams.....at least he's lasting longer in\nthat job than the others, and I think not wearing a red shirt helps. \n\nIt's too bad that Captain Garrovick is no longer alive.
