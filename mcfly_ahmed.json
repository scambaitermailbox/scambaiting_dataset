I have spoken with Dr Brown and he \ntoo is determined to push ahead as soon as possible having been persuaded of \nyour honesty. We have checked our schedules and, now that the flux capacitor \nis virtually finished, we can be with you almost yesterday, so to speak.<br><br>\n\nPerhaps we can meet up sometime next week. I am afraid that neither of us \nhave been to Dubai before (the nearest I have been is El Smegaroon, do you \nknow it?). If you can recommend somewhere decent to stay, nowhere that will \ncause any attention to our little party then we will be pleased to hear of \nit.  By all means let us have the documents you mention to look over. We can \nbring them with us.<br><br>\n\nIncidentally, so as prove beyond doubt that we really have a working \ncapacitor, Dr Brown has asked me to attach a picture. Please keep this \nconfidential. You may not be a scientific man, but you can take my word for \nit that, once it has been taken through the development stage, this little \nbeauty will prove revolutionary.<br><br>\n\nPlease write soon my friend\n</span>\n<br><br>\n<img src=\"images/mcfly_flux.jpg\"><br><br>\n\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "2005-07-14 00:00", "subject": "I NEED YOUR PASSPORT COPY OR DRIVING LICENSE", "author_role": "scam", "body": "Dear Marty,\n\nThanks for your mail, I got the flux picture and Am glad that everything is \nmoving great as you can see that you people have been able to achieve that \nflux capacittor.
