Hope all is well.\nMy Dear, I have  recieved your email and noted the content of it indicating what the bank need from us for the final release of our fund. \nAfter reading you email, I decided to visit the bank  to really know what they need from us and when I got there, I met with the transfer manager Mr. Segun Agbaje who is in charge of our fund and I told him that you just forwarded a congratulating email to me but that I did not understand it fully and he explained to me everything.\nFirstly, the bank transfer manager started congratulating me telling me that our fund has been programmed ready to be transfer that every things has been perfected which has made the bank to send you the final requirements of the transfer of our fund to you which includes: A DEATH CERTIFICATE OF MY LATE CLIENT, A POLICE REPORT THAT WILL SHOW THAT THE FUND IS NOT A TERORRIST FUND, AN AFFIDAVIT OF TRUE NEXT OF KIN IN YOUR NAME FROM THE FEDERAL HIGH COUNT OF JUSTICE ABUJA, $1, 500 DOLLARS FOR THE TRANSFER FEES which He told me that for the transfer charge that we have to pay it through western union money transfer with the banks secretary\ue5b8 name as stated on there email to you and that we are to email them with the payment information of the money sent and that as soon as they receive those requirements from us that the fund will be transfer to you and the transfer slip copy will be sent to you immediately for the confirmation of the transfer. \nAfter he told me all this, I asked and pleaded him to please assist us in deducting the transfer fees of $1,500 from the fund and for them to transfer the remaining as I know that I can work hard to secure those documents but he refused and told me that there is no how the bank can deduct money from a fund deposited under the constitutional laws of the bank and a fund that has programmed swift coded to be transfer, that it is not possible for the bank to take money out of it as it will be out of the laws of the bank if they do that, and I was very weak and on confusion as I dont know\nwhere to start from. \nTherefore, I decided to call a friend of mine who is also a legal colleague in my office that has attended to this kind of transaction to seek for his advice on what to do regarding the requirement that the bank asked from us. Now in his advice, he firstly told me that the most important and vital requirement that the bank has asked from us is the affidavit of true next of kin which is as well as the fund and without it, the fund will never be transferred to the next of kin as the affidavit stands to proof to the bank and the government that a kin to the said fund has legally claimed his or her left behind fund from the bank. \nHe said that your present would have been needed to sign the affidavit of true next of kin in the court but that if you are ask to come dawn that it will cost you a lot of money and it will as well delay the transferring of the fund but that what I have to do is to go to the court with about 7, 500 dollars so that I can pay for the court signatory  stamp which the court will stamp in the place of your signature when the affidavit is issue to me, my bother it is not easy for me.\nSecondly, he commented on the transfer charge that was given to us. He said that it is very right for a bank to ask for a transferring fees of any fund that is to be transferred out of the bank as the law of Nigerian constitution states boldly in degree 12 of 1987 act section 107 of banking law and constitution, that a transfer charge most be paid for any transaction of transferred fund both internationally or locally. He told me that every bank in the whole world do it that it is not out of the banking law. Finally, he told me that it is very mandatory for us to present those requested documents and transfer fees to the bank if only we want our fund transfer out of the bank and that by giving them all this they requested for, that it will make them to transfer the fund easily and without no delay so he told me that we should cooperate with the bank and finish them with all those informations they need from us that after all that it will not cost us that much compare to what we are about receiving so he concluded that we should give the bank all those information.\nAfter he told and advised me, I First of all said to him that I am happy that the bank has approved your name as the next of kin to the fund and has given to us what we need to provide to them for the immediate transfer of our fund in to your account which I believe that both of us can join hands together and do it.  \nNow For the urgency needed in this transaction, we both have to help in this matter, I will be going to Federal high court Abuja to secure the affidavit of true next of kin in your name as it is the must important and costest document out them all and your present would have been needed to sign the affidavit as the next of kin but due to the fact that it will delay us and cost you a lot of money to come to my country, I have decided to do it the way my friend advised me and as a lawyer here in my country, I believe I know what to do just that it will cost me a lot of money to do it.\nAfter securing that, I will go to the police station to get a police report which he told me that it will cover us from any question or problem from your government or my government as well clarify that the fund is not a terrorist fund and was a inherited fund. My Dear, Please I will only want you to assist me in sending the transfer fees of $1, 500 dollars and the death certificate to the bank as they requested so that as soon as I get those documents and you send the money to them, they will immediately transfer the fund to you and confirm to you the payment information SLIP of the fund as they have promise to do as soon as we forward those requirement to them immediately. \nMy Dear, I want you to be happy as we are about to conclude this transaction and after this point you and I would be greatly rich and you will no more work for any body but you will be the person to be employing people to work in your company. So now lets work to bring this desire to accomplishment by you sending the money to the bank and me going for all the certificates and submitting them to the bank for the immediate transfer of our fund. Meanwhile, I have to go now and talk with my wife if she can raise some money for my trip to Abuja, as I have to go to Abuja federal high court of justice with at least $8000 dollars, including my flight fees to Abuja now. \nFinally, I will want you to know that we don\ue5b9 have any time to waste as you know that the bank has made us know that our fund has been program to be transfer as soon as we present those required items to them so please you have to send them the money today so that as soon as I secure the certificates, they will transfer our fund to you and I will start coming up to your country for the sharing of the fund.
