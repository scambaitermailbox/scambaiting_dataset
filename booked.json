I am pleased that you may be interested in helping us. I will try to explain what we need as clearly and simply as I can.\n\nAs you may have already noted from our website, we are going through a major upgrade and certain parts of our offices have to remain closed during this short period.  You can however contact me directly through either of these two private numbers: + 44 8445 87X XXX or +44 8707 65X XXX\n\nAgain, just to recap: my company provide audio books, which are primarily aimed at people who for some reason or other are not able to read themselves.  Perhaps they are partially or completely blind, or perhaps they simply are unable to read for themselves either due to lack of education, or some other mental/physical impairment.   There are many companies throughout the world that distribute audio books, but unfortunately places such as Eastern Asia,  Russia and Africa are not very well supplied in this area and therefore my company are able to make good inroads in these particular areas.  Needless to say that without too much competition in these places, profits are very easily maximised.  Not only can we supply audio books to these countries for  lower than usual prices, but because there is virtually no competition our profits are approximately 30%-40% higher than they would be in Europe.\n\nWhat we are looking for is people in our target countries, such as Asia, Africa, Russia etc. to help us with creating our audio books.  To this end, we are looking for people to audio record themselves reading from a book. Of course, as we are aiming many of our products in the countries described above, it would be most advantageous to have people reading who have the same accent as the target audience.  This will of course make it much easier for people to understand.\n\nWe do not require professional voice actors.  The most important properties we are looking for is that the person has a good clear voice, and can read English text.\n\nThere would be absolutely no travel involved for this initial submission, however should you become successful in this enterprise it would  require you to come to our offices sometime in 2008 just to help with advertising (brochures, catalogues, interviews etc.) but this would only be required if your services are used 5-6 times.  Of course, all your travel and other expenses would be paid.  Of course, this would all depend on the quality of your initial test submission.\n\nIf you do have people who are able to help with this, this is the procedure we would follow:\n\n1. We would send you (by email attachment) the text of a sample book.\n2. Using your own recording equipment, you would then record yourself (audio only) reading from the book.\n3. Once you have completed the recording, you are to send it back to us by email attachment, or upload it to a site for us to download later.\n4. On receipt of the finished work, we would check the work out, and if we think your voice is suitable we would then send you payment in full.\n\nIf we find that you are suited to the work then we would send (by courier) our own professional audio recording equipment so that you are able to produce further recordings in a more professional way.  Full instructions will be given, in in some cases if we feel that your voice is extremely suitable, we may invite you over to our offices in future to do work in our professional recording studios.\n\nYou will of course be paid for your first test sample, however please note that because of past fraud attempts, we can only send payment on receipt of the completed work.\n\nNOTE: You MUST have the ability to record your own voice clearly, and also be able to send the work to us by MP3 attachment.  Full instructions will be given should you accept this work offer.\n\nPlease get back to me as soon as possible to let me know if you have anyone who would be suitable for this work.  As I mentioned previously, time is very short and we only have three positions available.  We do have one person in Abudja, Nigeria who has promised to complete some work for us so there may only be two positions available.  We expect these to be takenup very quickly.\n\nI hope that is of some help to you Miss Adams, and please do not hesitate to email me or call me if you need further clarification.\n\nSincere regards,\n\nMichael Palin - CEO\nPesky Pirate Audio & Video Productions Ltd.\n\n\n", "from_name": "Michael Palin", "date": "", "raw": "            <p><b>From:</b> Michael Palin<br>\n              <b>To:</b> Jani Adams</p>\n            <p>Dear Miss Adams,<br>\n              <br>\n              Thank you for your email and it was nice to hear from you again.

I will try to explain what we need as clearly and simply as I can.<br>\n              <br>\n              As you may have already noted from our website, we are going through a major upgrade and certain parts of our offices have to remain closed during this short period.  You can however contact me directly through either of these two private numbers: + 44 8445 87X XXX or +44 8707 65X XXX<br>\n              <br>\n              Again, just to recap: my company provide audio books, which are primarily aimed at people who for some reason or other are not able to read themselves.  Perhaps they are partially or completely blind, or perhaps they simply are unable to read for themselves either due to lack of education, or some other mental/physical impairment.   There are many companies throughout the world that distribute audio books, but unfortunately places such as Eastern Asia,  Russia and Africa are not very well supplied in this area and therefore my company are able to make good inroads in these particular areas.  Needless to say that without too much competition in these places, profits are very easily maximised.  Not only can we supply audio books to these countries for  lower than usual prices, but because there is virtually no competition our profits are approximately 30%-40% higher than they would be in Europe.<br>\n              <br>\n              What we are looking for is people in our target countries, such as Asia, Africa, Russia etc. to help us with creating our audio books.  To this end, we are looking for people to audio record themselves reading from a book. Of course, as we are aiming many of our products in the countries described above, it would be most advantageous to have people reading who have the same accent as the target audience.  This will of course make it much easier for people to understand.<br>\n              <br>\n              We do not require professional voice actors.  The most important properties we are looking for is that the person has a good clear voice, and can read English text.<br>\n              <br>\n              There would be absolutely no travel involved for this initial submission, however should you become successful in this enterprise it would  require you to come to our offices sometime in 2008 just to help with advertising (brochures, catalogues, interviews etc.) but this would only be required if your services are used 5-6 times.  Of course, all your travel and other expenses would be paid.  Of course, this would all depend on the quality of your initial test submission.<br>\n              <br>\n              If you do have people who are able to help with this, this is the procedure we would follow:<br>\n              <br>\n              1. We would send you (by email attachment) the text of a sample book.<br>\n              2. Using your own recording equipment, you would then record yourself (audio only) reading from the book.<br>\n              3. Once you have completed the recording, you are to send it back to us by email attachment, or upload it to a site for us to download later.<br>\n              4. On receipt of the finished work, we would check the work out, and if we think your voice is suitable we would then send you payment in full.<br>\n              <br>\n              If we find that you are suited to the work then we would send (by courier) our own professional audio recording equipment so that you are able to produce further recordings in a more professional way.  Full instructions will be given, in in some cases if we feel that your voice is extremely suitable, we may invite you over to our offices in future to do work in our professional recording studios.<br>\n              <br>\n              You will of course be paid for your first test sample, however please note that because of past fraud attempts, we can only send payment on receipt of the completed work.<br>\n              <br>\n              <strong>NOTE:</strong> You MUST have the ability to record your own voice clearly, and also be able to send the work to us by MP3 attachment.  Full instructions will be given should you accept this work offer.<br>\n              <br>\n              Please get back to me as soon as possible to let me know if you have anyone who would be suitable for this work.  As I mentioned previously, time is very short and we only have three positions available.  We do have one person in Abudja, Nigeria who has promised to complete some work for us so there may only be two positions available.  We expect these to be takenup very quickly.<br>\n              <br>\n              I hope that is of some help to you Miss Adams, and please do not hesitate to email me or call me if you need further clarification.<br>\n              <br>\n              Sincere regards,<br>\n              <br>\n              Michael Palin - CEO<br>\n            Pesky Pirate Audio &amp; Video Productions Ltd.</p>\n            <p>&nbsp;</p>\n", "comments": [], "to_name": "Jani Adams"}, {"author_role": "scam", "subject": "Re: I AM READY TO WORK WITH YOU", "body": "Dear Palin,\n\nI need the samples as you said, I am very sure that I can handle this for you, I am very fluent in English and also have some times been master to several ceremonies which I can also send the pics of some of the occassions.\n\nI am not ready to cheat you, I am looking for money to complete my project as I have told you so if you can personally assist me any how, I will never let you down.

Here are some rules that need to be followed:\n\n1. The entire text must be recorded for the initial sample.\n\n2. The text is split into chapters, for instance CHAPTER 1, CHAPTER 2, CHAPTER 3 and so on.  Before each chapter is read, you must speak the chapter number. For instance, before you read the text in Chapter 3 you must say \"Chapter 3\".  Allow a short pause (2 or 3 seconds) before you continue to read after announcing the chapter number.\n\n3. For your convenience (if you intend to send the completed work via email attachment) and to keep the sizes of the files you have to send to a minimum, you can split each recording into the short chapters.  For instance, instead of sending one very large recording, you can split the file into the corresponding chapters. Alternatively, if you wish, you can send the recording in one large MP3 file.\n\nBecause this is a test sample, please do not worry if you find any words hard to speak.  At this point that is not important.  For the matter of this test submission, we are just testing the suitability and tone of your voice.  Just read the text loud and clear.  Of course, you can stop the recoding whilst you take a short rest.  Please take care that you do not try to do too much at one time.\n\nAgain, there will be some words that you may find hard to know how to pronounce correctly.  You can either make an attempt or call me if you are unsure how to speak them, however, again do not worry if you find that you are struggling with some words.  This specific book has been chosen exactly because it does contain a lot of unusual words.  You will NOT be penalised if you get some words wrong.\n\nOn completion of the sample and on receipt of the finished recordings, payment will be send to you no less than 24 hours after we receive your sample.  You will have to sign a short release form.  This is just a short form that gives us permission to use your recordings in any future work.\n\nRemember: It is not important this this test submission is perfect.  This submission is just to show us how you can cope with reading and to show us that you can keep reading in the same manner throughout an entire book.  Once we are satisfied that you are able to do the work then we will be providing you with all the help and professional recording equipment that is required.\n\n\nPAYMENT TERMS\n\nPayment for the test submission will be as follows:\n\n1. The sample book contains over 100 but less than 200 pages.  Payment amount due therefore on completion will be UK \u00a38725\n2. The sample audio must be provided in good quality MP3 format - Preferably sampled at a bitrate of at least 128kbps\n3. Absolutely NO MUSIC or other effects, other than the speaker's voice to appear on the recording.\n4. Payment is only made on receipt of COMPLETED work.  Partial work will not be eligible for payment.\n5. Payment shall be made within 24 (twenty four) hours of the COMPLETED work.\n6. Payment shall be made in the form of the payee's choosing.\n\n\nI hope that is clear to you Miss Adams.  Please do get in touch if you need any further clarification.  I would also appreciate it if you were able to give me an approximate date when you think you will be able to provide the finished sample?\n\nSincere regards,\n\nMichael Palin - CEO\nPesky Pirate Audio & Video Productions Ltd.\nHHGTTG PDF ATTACHED\n\n\n", "from_name": "Michael Palin", "date": "", "raw": "            <p><b>From:</b> Michael Palin<br>\n              <b>To:</b> Jani Adams</p>\n            <p>Dear Miss Adams,<br>\n              <br>\n              Please find attached a PDF document containing the text.
