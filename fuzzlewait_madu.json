All wire transfer agencies, whether Moneygram or Western Union, are REQUIRED by anti-money laundering federal legislation to have copies of the receipient's passport and have these forms filled in BEFORE they could transfer any funds. This fact went completely beyond Mr Chamber's comprehension ability. When I told him about this fact and sent him the Moneygram forms to complete, he demanded that I use Western Union instead. He even claimed that he would not tolerate any delay, no matter from whom. He should try telling that to the federal government when they demand to know why he did not fill out their required forms. A complete idiot! I never dealt with such a foolish clown masquerading as a man! And he is a lawyer? I then explained this fact to him again and then sent him Western Union's forms to complete.\n\n\nAnother fact that he had trouble grasping is that by the time he fills in the forms, sends them to me, I hand them in to the wire transfer service, and they have these forms verified, I would be flying to Burkino Faso. There is simply not enough time to arrange a wire transfer - these forms have to be filled in and verified before any funds are sent. His delaying tactics did not help matters any. I told him the only way around these regulations is for me to come to Burkino Faso with the necessary cash. That way there would be no forms to fill in and I could give him the cash directly.\n\n\nAfter arriving in Ouagadougou, I met Mr Chambers. Although he is far from bright (or \"not all there\" as you may say), he may suit our needs. \n\n\nI asked Mr Chambers to book a hotel room in Ouagadougou for me, citing several possibilities. The hotel that he selected and I was taken to after being met at the airport was different from the ones that I suggested but this hotel is still adequate. Following his advice, I checked in using an alias in order to remove any possibility of suspicion of collaboration between you and I.\n\n\n I then gave Mr Chambers the requested amount for the certificates that he needs to complete the transaction. I told him that if these fees were inadequate or if any unexpected expenses occurred, I did have a considerable sum of money left over and could pay him. He just had to come by the hotel and let me know.\n\n\nI am still awaiting news from him. I suggest that you contact him to find out where he is in the process of getting the certificates and completing our transaction and then relay this information to me.\n\n\nYours,\nLord Fuzzlewait", "raw": "<div id=\"record\">\n\t<div id=\"char\"><span class=\"lf\">Lord Fuzzlewait</span>\n\t<p class=\"lfc\">(Me to Madu.

All wire transfer agencies, whether Moneygram or Western Union, are REQUIRED by anti-money laundering federal legislation to have copies of the receipient's passport and have these forms filled in BEFORE they could transfer any funds. This fact went completely beyond Mr Chamber's comprehension ability. When I told him about this fact and sent him the Moneygram forms to complete, he demanded that I use Western Union instead. He even claimed that he would not tolerate any delay, no matter from whom. He should try telling that to the federal government when they demand to know why he did not fill out their required forms. A complete idiot! I never dealt with such a foolish clown masquerading as a man! And he is a lawyer?
