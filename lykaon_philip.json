At the Lancaster House Conference prior to independence in 1980,the Patriotic Front argued that the British Government must provide money as compensation for white settlers occupation and this was paid by the British Government, this statement below, was issued by the immediate post independence Government led by Mr Robert Mugabe when Britain and The USA offered to pay compensation  for white farmers land acquisition: \"We have now obtained  assurances that Britain, the United States of America and other countries will participate in a multinational donor effort to assist in land, agricultural and economic development program .

After more than 30 years of struggles we failed - let's face it - to bring the People's Republic in Greece. All that we managed was to succeed in a separatist movement we started in the nineties which resulted in the segregation from Greece of the minuscule Free Republic of Glykotsoutsounoi, a very small area of just 1600 square kilometres in SW Crete (that's a big island of Greece) which contains two small towns, Glykotsoutsounoi and Roufamouton, and four tiny villages: Sedoulevo, Malaka, Kaidento and Psiliazesai.\n\n\nEven in this tiny peace of Greece assigned to us by History, we did not get exactly what we wanted, a true People's Republic in the pure Marxist - Leninist sense.

I explain:\n\nOne or two days after I was first contacted by Moore, I started receiving e-mails (one or two every two days initially, more and more as days go by), all of them from people in various countries of Southern Africa, asking me to do them some money-transfer service, similar to the one I'm doing to you.\n\nNone of them appeared to be some People's Revolutionary in need of help like you or, at least, some honest person in distress. All of them 1st rank relations (widows or sons or daughters or brothers or sisters) of killed or deceased reactionary bastards such as fascist military big-brass, right-wing politicians, high ranking economists or executives or engineers working for notorious multinational trusts, this kind of scum. In all cases their dead relative has acquired with the most obscure means huge sums of money, which consequently has been somehow blocked in a some bank account, and now they seek my help to unblock it and get their hands on it, offering me a considerable percentage.\n\nMy first impulse was to communicate my indignation to those decadent lackeys of Imperialism. How do they dare ask of me, Lykaon Spartiatiakos, a seasoned Communist, for 30 years fighter for the rights of the people, now Secretary of the Local Organization of Roufamouton of the Communist Party of Glykotsoutsounoi (Marxist - Leninist), to launder their dirty money for them, money they have looted from the Peoples of Africa by terrorizing, robbing and murdering them? Do they think that I would yield to their luring offers and forego my principles for just a 5 or 10 percent of the loot?\n\nOn seconds thoughts I decided to ignore them and keep a low profile in order not to compromise our cause in any way. However the very disconcerting question sprang directly to my mind. How on earth did all these people knew of my e-mail address and how on earth would they assume that I would be interested in laundering money, if they new not that I was doing a money-transfer service for you. (In your case, of course, this is not laundering of dirty money, but I doubt these decadent imperialist lackeys can make such fine discernment). In the beginning I suspected they got the info from you. That either you have talked to someone you should have not or that the fascists of Zimbabwe got you from house arrest to jail and tortured you. I ruled out the possibility of you having talked to the wrong person, you appear quite seasoned in underground tactics to have done such a mistake but, torturing?... Forgive me comrade, I mean not offending you or doubting your courage, strength of will and integrity but, believe me, I have seen formidable revolutionaries bend under torture and spit everything out, it's human and I doubt if we should blame them. So I have tried eagerly for a few days to learn about events in Zimbabwe, to see if any news about Philip Ukulele drag from house arrest to prison would come out. I asked a young comrade's help, who's very able with these things, (I have mentioned this person in previous e-mails, I consult with him on anything technologic) and we tried to learn anything going on currently in Zimbabwe through satellite-tv and the web-sites of major newspapers. I must say I have admired your ability to keep a low profile comrade, your name was nowhere to be mentioned in none of those resources. So, having put my heart at ease regarding the information on me having leaked-out from you, I set to think of other possible sources ... And the idea sprang to my mind violently, as a revelation! But of course, how stupid of me not to have thought about it from the very beginning! Mike Moore, our Dutch capitalist who's firm appears to be earning a substantial living from such transactions, who else might have been?! The idea became a certainty and I was very careful to lay very low after that.\n\nFinally the capitalistic scum has contacted me and, as you can read in the correspondence I forward you, he has been trying to keep control of the whole affair. Such a fool he is to think that he can manipulate me! I have years and years of experience in negotiating, always representing the People's interests, with their lot and I know when I must be a hard negotiator and how to impose my own terms. As you can read, I changed my schedule and I took full control of the proceedings by refusing to reveal to him any details of my planed movements. I will avoid communicating them to you also, no offence brother and comrade, but the walls have ears!\n\nWorry not though, by May 21st the whole transaction will have successfully concluded and I will contact you in order to deliver you the money in person.\n\nLong live the struggle of the oppressed nations and peoples, long live the struggle of the Proletariat, long live the memories of comrades Marx, Enghels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao-Tse-Tung\n\nBest Regards\n\nLykaon Spartiatiakos\nSecretary of the Local Organization of Roufamouton of the Communist Party of Glykotsoutsounoi (Marxist - Leninist)", "raw": "<hr>\n\n<font face=\"Georgia,Arial,Verdana\"><font color=\"black\"><i>Certainly \"Ukulele\" must have been worrying all these weeks about his victim receiving more e-mails of the \"Nigerian Scum\" type, that would help the poor fool realize that he was been swindled.

Lykaon at this point decided to put him through the \"Scottish Shower\": His character would reveal to \"Ukulele\" that he had received numerous \"Nigerian Scum\" e-mails (at this point \"Ukulele\" would gulp in anguish) and right afterwards offer an interpretation of why, in spite of the \"Nigerian Scum\" bombardment he had completely failed to realize that \"Ukulele\" - or any other of the \"Niggerian scamers\" for that matter - where lying (and \"Ukulele's\" heart would go at its place again).

All of them 1st rank relations (widows or sons or daughters or brothers or sisters) of killed or deceased reactionary bastards such as fascist military big-brass, right-wing politicians, high ranking economists or executives or engineers working for notorious multinational trusts, this kind of scum. In all cases their dead relative has acquired with the most obscure means huge sums of money, which consequently has been somehow blocked in a some bank account, and now they seek my help to unblock it and get their hands on it, offering me a considerable percentage.\n<br><br>\nMy first impulse was to communicate my indignation to those decadent lackeys of Imperialism. How do they dare ask of me, Lykaon Spartiatiakos, a seasoned Communist, for 30 years fighter for the rights of the people, now Secretary of the Local Organization of Roufamouton of the Communist Party of Glykotsoutsounoi (Marxist - Leninist), to launder their dirty money for them, money they have looted from the Peoples of Africa by terrorizing, robbing and murdering them? Do they think that I would yield to their luring offers and forego my principles for just a 5 or 10 percent of the loot?<br><br>\n\nOn seconds thoughts I decided to ignore them and keep a low profile in order not to compromise our cause in any way. However the very disconcerting question sprang directly to my mind. How on earth did all these people knew of my e-mail address and how on earth would they assume that I would be interested in laundering money, if they new not that I was doing a money-transfer service for you. (In your case, of course, this is not laundering of dirty money, but I doubt these decadent imperialist lackeys can make such fine discernment). In the beginning I suspected they got the info from you. That either you have talked to someone you should have not or that the fascists of Zimbabwe got you from house arrest to jail and tortured you. I ruled out the possibility of you having talked to the wrong person, you appear quite seasoned in underground tactics to have done such a mistake but, torturing?... Forgive me comrade, I mean not offending you or doubting your courage, strength of will and integrity but, believe me, I have seen formidable revolutionaries bend under torture and spit everything out, it's human and I doubt if we should blame them. So I have tried eagerly for a few days to learn about events in Zimbabwe, to see if any news about Philip Ukulele drag from house arrest to prison would come out. I asked a young comrade's help, who's very able with these things, (I have mentioned this person in previous e-mails, I consult with him on anything technologic) and we tried to learn anything going on currently in Zimbabwe through satellite-tv and the web-sites of major newspapers. I must say I have admired your ability to keep a low profile comrade, your name was nowhere to be mentioned in none of those resources. So, having put my heart at ease regarding the information on me having leaked-out from you, I set to think of other possible sources ... And the idea sprang to my mind violently, as a revelation! But of course, how stupid of me not to have thought about it from the very beginning! Mike Moore, our Dutch capitalist who's firm appears to be earning a substantial living from such transactions, who else might have been?! The idea became a certainty and I was very careful to lay very low after that.<br><br>\n\nFinally the capitalistic scum has contacted me and, as you can read in the correspondence I forward you, he has been trying to keep control of the whole affair. Such a fool he is to think that he can manipulate me! I have years and years of experience in negotiating, always representing the People's interests, with their lot and I know when I must be a hard negotiator and how to impose my own terms. As you can read, I changed my schedule and I took full control of the proceedings by refusing to reveal to him any details of my planed movements. I will avoid communicating them to you also, no offence brother and comrade, but the walls have ears!\n<br><br>\nWorry not though, by May 21st the whole transaction will have successfully concluded and I will contact you in order to deliver you the money in person.\n<br><br>\nLong live the struggle of the oppressed nations and peoples, long live the struggle of the Proletariat, long live the memories of comrades Marx, Enghels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao-Tse-Tung<br><br>\n\nBest Regards<br><br>\n\nLykaon Spartiatiakos<br>\nSecretary of the Local Organization of Roufamouton of the Communist Party of Glykotsoutsounoi (Marxist - Leninist)<br><br>\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "", "author_role": "scam", "body": "dear sir,                                                                         18/05/04\nthanks for your mail,the contents are well understood.however i want you to understand that the only grey area that you will need to firm up with us is this issue of meeting in a public place we do not run a disorganised operation here, as soon as you call me a protocol person or a driver will be dispatched to pick you and bring you to our office i can assure you that our operations are top class to say the least and if no customer of ours had complained in the past yours will not be an exception.please confirm that i made myself clear.let me also remind you that your  code number is mandatory and please do not forget the handling and administrative fees.please notify me if you will want any form of additional services.\nthanks for your past cooperation.\nregards\nMike Moore", "raw": "<hr>\n\n<font face=\"Georgia,Arial,Verdana\"><font color=\"black\"><i>\"Moore/Ukulele\" tries to dissuade Lykaon' character from trying to arrange a meeting in a public area.
