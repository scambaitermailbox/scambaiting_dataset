    "I open up with a familiar but slightly modified routine.",
    "Of course, as expected Abu knows just the people for the job!",
    "The next day I send Abu an email containing 6 very high resolutions scans of streetmaps and further instructions.",
    "Post my maps to Abu? That would involve spending money. That's not going to happen here buddy!",
    "Well, two weeks later Abu finally sends in the hand drawn map samples.",
    "Two weeks later, Abu decides he's not up to the job.",
    "Time to give Abu a bit of a scare to prompt some action.",
    "'Prophet' Ubabuike gets in touch.",
    "Ubabuike lets me know the first set of maps are complete.",
    "The prophet doesn't take kindly to my critique'.",
    "Two days later, the new scans arrive.",
    "Time to give Ubabuike a little encouragement.",
    "A few days later Ubabuike gets back in touch.",
    "Lets see if I can get this guy to do some more work!",
    "No reply for quite a while. I though I had lost Ubabuike but he replies just as I was about to give up on him.",
    "A few days go by and then then the identification and sworn oaths arrive.",
    "I want to know how my circuit diagrams are going.",
    "Seems Ubabuike thinks he's getting his payment before I receive my new samples from him.",
    "I'll just ignore his request and ask about my samples again.",
    "Over a week later and I finally get a reply.",
    "I think Ubabuike may be getting slightly suspicious!",
    "Two days later and Ubabuike seems to be questioning my honesty. How dare he!",
    "Time to put this guy in his place.",
    "The circuit diagram samples have obviously been drawn in haste and definitely not by the same people that drew the previous maps. I suspect that Ubabuike himself drew the circuit diagrams. Perhaps the map guys wanted some cash upfront before working for him again! Anyway, they are totally unacceptable, and I think it's time we let him know it. Arthur Dent is taking a short break, so step in Dirk Gently.",
    "Ubabuike didn't reply to Dirk, so a few days later Arthur Dent gets in touch."

Many maps\nhave to be drawn by hand because of various reasons, such as the\nlocation is not suitable for the setting up of computerised cartography\nsystems etc. These hand drawn maps are then brought to us and our\nrecognition systems convert the hand drawn maps into professional\ncomputerised maps.\n\nSo, what we require are people who have the ability to draw by hand\ncopies of street or roadmaps for us to test and train our computer\nrecognition systems on.\n\nWe require people who are proficient at copying/drawing by hand,\ncopies of maps. If you think you have people who are qualified to\ndo such work then we would certainly be very interested in inviting\nthem over to discuss various employment packages.\n\nWe would of course be willing to pay all expenses in advance including\nof course flight tickets etc, however before we would be willing\nto interview them here we would require a small sample of their\nwork to be sent to us by email attachment. We would send you a sample\nstreetmap my email attachment and your people would need to make\na copy of the maps BY HAND in as much detail as possible and then\nreturn a scan of their work by email attachment. If the work is\nacceptable then we would immediately give your people an invitation\nto come and meet with us, and of course send your travel expenses\netc. by whatever way best suits your means.\n\nPlease signal your agreement to our terms and then I will forward\nyou a sample map to copy. Also please inform me how many people\nyou have that would like to apply for the available positions. Currently\nwe have 10 positions available, however I expect these positions\nto be filled quite quickly.\nYou may contact me on +44 8707 XXX XXX if you require further instructions.\n\nSincerely.\n\nArthur Dent BSC.

Let me quote from my email of 28th January:\n\n\"It is of extreme importance that the finished work is large\nand clear and represents the original images as closely as possible.\nI shall leave the size of the map you recreate to your own choice,\nhowever the bigger and more detailed you are able to make it the\nbetter for us.\"\n\n\"When you have completed the hand drawn version of the maps\nyou will then need to scan the pages IN HIGH QUALITY to that the\nimage or images you send back to us by email attachment of LARGE\nand CLEAR.\"\n\nThe size of the images and the size of the files are TINY. A good\nHIGH QUALITY scan should be at least 2 MEGABYTES in size. The physical\nsize of the images should be at LEAST 2,000 pixels wide. Just compare\nthe size of the picture YOU sent with the size of the ORIGINALS\nI sent. In fact, I have attached your image to this email, and my\nimage to this email. It will be quite obvious to you how inadequate\nyour image is.\n\nSincerely.\n\nArthur Dent BSC. HHGTTG. PhD.\nDirector\nSinglesideband Systems\n\n\n",

You are obviously the same as your partner \n              and have ZERO seriousness in this deal. Not only are the scans TINY, \n              but they are mostly blurred and absolutely 100% totally unacceptable. \n              Have I waited many weeks for such rubbish?<br>\n              <br>\n              The maps MAY be acceptable if they were scanned correctly, but it \n              seems to me you have employed the skills of a blind man to do them \n              for you.<br>\n              <br>\n              These scans are an absolute joke. They are pathetic to the extreme. \n              Do you have any idea what the words LARGE and CLEAR actually mean? \n              You are insulting my intelligence. Please do not waste my time any \n              further. I have SERIOUS people to deal with who want SERIOUS jobs. \n              I have no time for your child's play.<br>\n              <br>\n              Just take a serious look at the rubbish you sent to me which I have \n              attached to this email. They are absolutely TINY compared to the \n              original images that I sent to you. Tell me, do you have a monkey \n              in charge of the scanning? I know that you are probably not responsible \n              for the scanning yourself, but whoever he is I suggest you get rid \n              of that imbecile as soon as possible.<br>\n              <br>\n              Now, I have attached your three awful images and ONE sample of the \n              SIZE &amp; QUALITY I am expecting from your scans. If you cannot \n              scan anything properly then do not waste my time any further.<br>\n              <br>\n              Look at the dimensions of the map I sent to you.

      "body": "Dear Mr. Ubabuike,\n\nThe scans that you sent to me are absolutely of DISGUSTINGLY BAD\nsize and scan quality. You are obviously the same as your partner\nand have ZERO seriousness in this deal. Not only are the scans TINY,\nbut they are mostly blurred and absolutely 100% totally unacceptable.\nHave I waited many weeks for such rubbish?\n\nThe maps MAY be acceptable if they were scanned correctly, but it\nseems to me you have employed the skills of a blind man to do them\nfor you.\n\nThese scans are an absolute joke. They are pathetic to the extreme.\nDo you have any idea what the words LARGE and CLEAR actually mean?\nYou are insulting my intelligence. Please do not waste my time any\nfurther. I have SERIOUS people to deal with who want SERIOUS jobs.\nI have no time for your child's play.\n\nJust take a serious look at the rubbish you sent to me which I have\nattached to this email. They are absolutely TINY compared to the\noriginal images that I sent to you. Tell me, do you have a monkey\nin charge of the scanning? I know that you are probably not responsible\nfor the scanning yourself, but whoever he is I suggest you get rid\nof that imbecile as soon as possible.\n\nNow, I have attached your three awful images and ONE sample of the\nSIZE & QUALITY I am expecting from your scans. If you cannot\nscan anything properly then do not waste my time any further.\n\nLook at the dimensions of the map I sent to you. It is 2800 ( TWO\nTHOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED) pixels wide by 3644 (THREE THOUSAND SIX\nHUNDRED FORTY FOUR) pixels in height. Now compare that to the scans\nthat you send to me. Yours are TINY at just 480 pixels by 640 pixels.\nThat is absolutely unacceptable.\n\nIf you cannot make a VAST improvement on the scan quality then I\nam afraid you are wasting your time and you are wasting my time.\n\nSincerely.\n\nArthur Dent BSC.
