Your accusations are understandable, and I turn to Bengt for patience in explaining your mistakes:\n \n(1) I am not a liar, and it is true that I do not have a scanner. If you look at my license, you can clearly see that I am holding it with my thumb. I took a picture of myself holding it, and sent the picture. Why would I scan my thumb holding my license?

You clearly said you did not want to \"talk of church,\" so I did not call you to say it (I did include it in my previous email, however). I was using a friend's calling card, and the call was dropped. I then realized that it was quite late in Africa, and decided not to call back. Your pastor emailed me, and I will clear it up with him. That is a matter between us, and not you. You're the one that said keep him out of the business -- why are you bringing him into it?\n \nYou have never allowed me to explain that I do not have a direct line for you to reach me at. You simply jumped to the conclusion that I am hiding something from you, and accused me of dishonesty. You called the number I gave first, and that is a number of a church member. You are the one who keeps saying we must keep this business between us -- why would I have to call that number again? They did not know you, so they did not talk to you, and they became suspicious that I gave out their number for my use. After you called they began asking questions why I was trying to recieve personal calls to their number. I do not want to involve anyone in anything that will jeopordize our transaction. I am able to get calling cards, and I don't have a problem calling you, but I want the picture first.\n \nYou are quick to judge, and do remember that haste makes waste. Do try to be more patient, as it is a virtuous trait among men of God. I was not lying, so you have no reason to doubt my honesty or integrity. This is why I forgive you Brother Harrison, as it was a simple mistake on your part.

Your accusations are understandable, and I turn to Bengt for patience in explaining your mistakes:<br /><br />\n \n(1) I am not a liar, and it is true that I do not have a scanner. If you look at my license, you can clearly see that I am holding it with my thumb. I took a picture of myself holding it, and sent the picture. Why would I scan my thumb holding my license? I'm sorry that I used the word \"scan,\" but you see what I mean. If you would like me to take a picture of the signed agreement, I can.\n <br /><br />\n(2) I did call Pastor David last night to wish him a happy and blessed Ash Wednesday. You clearly said you did not want to \"talk of church,\" so I did not call you to say it (I did include it in my previous email, however). I was using a friend's calling card, and the call was dropped. I then realized that it was quite late in Africa, and decided not to call back. Your pastor emailed me, and I will clear it up with him. That is a matter between us, and not you. You're the one that said keep him out of the business -- why are you bringing him into it?<br /><br />\n \nYou have never allowed me to explain that I do not have a direct line for you to reach me at. You simply jumped to the conclusion that I am hiding something from you, and accused me of dishonesty. You called the number I gave first, and that is a number of a church member. You are the one who keeps saying we must keep this business between us -- why would I have to call that number again? They did not know you, so they did not talk to you, and they became suspicious that I gave out their number for my use. After you called they began asking questions why I was trying to recieve personal calls to their number. I do not want to involve anyone in anything that will jeopordize our transaction. I am able to get calling cards, and I don't have a problem calling you, but I want the picture first.\n <br /><br />\nYou are quick to judge, and do remember that haste makes waste. Do try to be more patient, as it is a virtuous trait among men of God. I was not lying, so you have no reason to doubt my honesty or integrity. This is why I forgive you Brother Harrison, as it was a simple mistake on your part.
