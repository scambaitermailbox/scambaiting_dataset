One you have\nscanned in the LARGE and CLEAR photograph, please send it back to\nme as an attachment.\nOnce both the photograph and the agreement form have been received\nand approved, your donation payment will be paid out IMMEDIATELY\nin a manner of your choosing. If the amount is too large for your\npreferred method of payment we will be happy to split the donation\ninto more manageable amounts.\nMy good brother Rao, of course I fully understand that the picture\nrequest seems very strange, but as I have explained before, it is\nthis very strangeness that will ensure to the Donation Committee\nthat the image is not a forgery.\nIf you are in agreement with the church's request, please get back\nto me ASAP and I will forward you the agreement form. You will also\nbe given a Donation Agreement reference number which you must quote\non all future correspondence.\n\nBrother Rao, please let me know if you are unable to comply with\nthe request above as we have received many applications for financial\nassistance and if you are unable to comply we shall have to award\nthe payment to the next worthy cause.\n\nMay God bless you and your family,\n\nFather William Wallace.\nThe Holy Church of Fish, Bread and Wine.\n\n\n", "comments": ["[AGREEMENT FORM ATTACHED]"], "date": ""}, {"to_name": "", "from_name": "Pastor Kothapalli Prabhakara Rao", "author_role": "scam", "raw": "            <p align=\"left\"><i>From: Pastor Kothapalli Prabhakara Rao<br>\n              Subject: fellowship<br>\n              Date: Wed, 21 Jan 2004 09:49:38 +0000 (GMT)</i></p>\n            <p align=\"left\"><i>Dear Father William Wallace,<br>\n              I am here sending the agreement form filled duely, and also the \n              photograph of mine in the way you instructed me.
