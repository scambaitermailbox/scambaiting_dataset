I regret any initial embarrassment my letter might cause you as we have not had any correspondence before this time. My name is Gbenga Williams Jnr, the eldest son of the slain PDP frontline aspirant for the Lagos Governor's office 2007. He was stabbed in several places in the chest region by yet to be identified persons on Thursday 28th July 2006.\nIt was believed that these assasins came on a tip off that my late dad was supposed to take delivary at his residence on that fateful Thursday his contract deal entitlement of US$65 Million Dollars in liquid cash which did not arrive until after the incidence.\nI am contacting you in view of the fact that we will be of great assistance to each other. I currently have in my possession the said amount of Sixty-Five Million U.S Dollars (US$65 Million) cash which l intend to move out quickly to safety specifically in your country although not sure yet on what areas of business to invest it on. Please advise. \nAfter my late dad was strangled to death, I have declared my father's bank bankrupt. There is no record of this money traceable by our Government or this assasins because no document exists showing that I received such money. However, due to the current situation in the country now regarding my late father's death within his political caucus and the entire political parties and recurrent insecurities over human lives, it has become quite impossible for me to make use of this money within. This informs my intention to transfer the money out of the country for investment. Please contact me as a matter of urgency to enable us discuss the transfer in details. \nI need your co-operation in moving the money out of the country to any overseas country where we can both invest the money in any profitable business venture that you may suggest. I will keep 65% for the up-keep of the entire whole family and you will keep 30% of the US$65m if you provide the required assistance and co-operation needed to move this funds overseas and the rest 5% for offsetting minor expenses that may be incurred during the course of this transaction.\nIf you are interested, please contact me by return mail indicating your private telephone and fax numbers for further discussion.
