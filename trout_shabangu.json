You can view my profile at my website\n\n http://www.gov.za/gol/gcis_profile.jsp?id=1066\n\nAfter the swearing in ceremony making me Deputy Minister Safety and Security,\nmy husband Mr Ndelebe Shabangu died while he was on an official trip to\nTrinidad and Tobago in 2002. After his death, I discovered that he had some\nfunds in a dollar account which mounted to the sum of US$3.5M with FINANCE\nSECURITY HOUSE .\n\nThis fund emanated as a result of an over-invoiced contract which he executed\nwith the Government of South Africa. Though I\n\nassisted him in getting this contract but I never knew that it was\nover-invoiced by him. I am afraid that the government of South Africa might\nstart to investigate on contracts awarded from 1998 to date. If they discover\nthis money in his bank account, they will confiscate it and seize his assets\nhere in South Africa and this will definetely affect my political career in\ngovernment.\n\nI want your assistance in clearing this money from FINANCE SECURITY HOUSE. As\nsoon as the fund is cleared, you are expected to move it immediately into\nanother personal bank account in your country. I will see to it that the\naccount is not traced from South Africa. As soon as you have confirmed the fund\ninto your account, I will send my eldest son with my Attorney to come to your\ncountry to discuss on business investments.\n\nFor your assistance, I am offering you (Seven Hundred Thousand United States\nDollars Only) However, you have to assure me and also be ready to go into\nagreement with me that you will not elope with my fund.\n\nIf you agree to my terms, kindly as a matter of urgency send me an email. Due\nto my sensitive position in the South African\n\nGovernment, I would not WANT you to call me on phone or send a fax to me. All\ncorrespondence must be by email to my private email.\n\nIf you want to speak with my Attorney, that is fine and okay by me. His\nchambers will be representing my interest with you.

In my latest email from Dr. Olanrewoju at the bank\nhe seems to say that he will cover the $7,000 expense.  He wrote (after I sent\nhim the US Government form 8300 that needs to be completed to facilitate the\nfunds transfer), \"The FORM 8300 is purely for your tax over there and it is not\nour duty to take care of your tax...\"  I assume that he meant that he will take\ncare of any taxes and fees in Nigeria if I take care of the paperwork and fees\nhere in the United States.  You might want to check with him to be sure that's\nwhat he meant.\n <br><br>\nIn the meantime I'll talk to Mr. Rosewater, my accountant, and see if I can\nconvince him to release the money based on a copy of the document.  \n<br><br>\nMaybe you could attach the invoice to an email and send it to me so that I can\nshow Mr. Rosewater.
