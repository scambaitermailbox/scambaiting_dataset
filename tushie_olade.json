Mama i don' t want you to keep silent over this my matter i am just begging you for this.<br />\nYou know how to help me mama to be frankly speaking, if you have intention to help me i believe you can do something even for you to talk to Lady Agatha over my matter you can do it.  I believe in you and God will help you too.<br /><br />\n \nPlease mama look into my matter, for me to write letter to you is not easy, if i go to church on sunday some brethren can give me something  and out of this i have to by 30 or 1hr to write message, if it is weekly days , i have to  help the owner of the cybercafe sweep before she will give me 30minutes to check my box.  So the situation here is too hard.<br /><br />\n \nSo mama please meet Lady Agatha for me and whatever you can afford to help me please do it for me.<br />\nMay God be with you and your house.<br />\nDavies Olade. \n\n\n</p>\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "", "author_role": "bait", "body": "21 May\n\nDearest Son,\n\n \n\nI have instructed Lady Agatha to send you one hundred golden dorks.\n\n \n\nI am sure she will soon be in touch.\n\n\nRemain blessed,\n\n\nTUSHIE MESHUGANAH                                                                                                  The Holy Bagel Community", "raw": "<hr>\n\n<span class=\"tm\">Tushie Meshuganah</span>\n<p class=\"ast\">\n\n\n\n21 May<br /><br />\n\nDearest Son,\n\n <br /><br />\n\nI have instructed Lady Agatha to send you one hundred golden dorks.\n<br /><br />\n \n\nI am sure she will soon be in touch.\n<br /><br />\n\nRemain blessed,<br /><br />\n\n\nTUSHIE MESHUGANAH   <br />                                                                                               The Holy Bagel Community\n\n                                                                                                                                           \n      </p>\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "", "author_role": "bait", "body": "Dear Tushie,\n\nThe gentleman has not emailed me back with proof of\nhis ID and this frankly rather outlandish proposal.", "raw": "<hr>\n<div id=\"aside\">\n<span class=\"ab\">Lady Agatha Bristol</span>\n<p class=\"ast\">\n\n                                                                                                                                     \n                                                                                                                                           \nDear Tushie,<br /><br />\n\nThe gentleman has not emailed me back with proof of\nhis ID and this frankly rather outlandish proposal.                                                  \n  </p>\n</div>\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "", "author_role": "scam", "body": "Dear Lady Agatha,\n                                        Greetings to\nyou in Jesus name.
