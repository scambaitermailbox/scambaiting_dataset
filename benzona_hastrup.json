During the war, President Taylor disbursed large sums\nof Monies to buy the loyalty of the entire cabinet,and I can say with all\nmodesty that I was one of the Chief Beneficiaries of this disbursement.\nThis is aside from monies I used my official position to acquire while in\noffice.Since we relocated to Calabar, Southern Nigeria all has been well, but with the recent\nindictment of former President Taylor by the war crime tribunal sitting in\nSierra Leone and confirmed reports of a dedicated fund by the American\nGovernment to capture him in order to face war crime charges have now decided to\nleave the country.\n\n\nPresently I have funds totaling $15,000,000.
