It was actually declared as family treasures worth $20.5 million dollars and insured to that amount for security reasons.\n  \n\nNow, my life and material possessions means nothing to me. My decision to distribute the funds to charity is borne out of inner guilt for not inducing my late husband in contributing enough to ameliorate the sufferings of the less privilege ones dying of hunger, malnutrition, famine, epidemics and millions of people displaced by civil wars around the war. I think that God purposely spared my life for this purpose because I lost everyone so dear to me and am just only holding on to life until this particular purpose is fulfilled. The doctor report says I have severe internal bleeding and that my days are very short. Hence I want to move very quickly on this before my demise so that God will accept my soul and forgive my entire family.\n  \nWithout taking much of your time, note that the details of this transaction has only been revealed to you. To build trust and confidence between us before I furnish you more details and copies of claims documents, we must have to go into mutual agreements by you signing a confidentiality pact with me never to divulge details of this transaction to anyone else until the purpose is accomplished in order not to jeopardize your chances of clearing the funds from the storage facility,and also to assure me that as soon as the funds are been released to you that you will not betray me by take all of the funds to your self,because i have decided to award you 30% of the total sum as remuneration for your help and time in distributing the funds among charities and orphanage homes. Another 5% will be set aside to offset any expenses during the course of liberating the funds.  \n\nUpon receipt of your willingness to proceed under the above mentioned condition,you are to contact my family lawyer immediately with your full contact details, your full names, your resident address and your telephone number to enable him equip you with relevant claim documents and contact details of the storage firm in Madrid Spain to enable you open up communication with them to enquire on the modalities of clearing the deposit.  \n\nSo kindly contact my family lawyer immediately in the UK before he lives for Ireland because i do not have his Ireland contact.  \n\nSee his contact details below:  \nName:  \nEmail:  \nTel :  \nYou are to contact him immediately and introduce your self to him as my next of kins,and he knows what and what to do for you.  \n\n\nPlease i am hoping on you and i don't want you to betray this trust i have for you by you taking the full funds to your self as soon as the trunk box has been released to you.  \n\nPlease alway feel free to always contact me if i am still life.  \nMay God Bless you,and use you for me to help the lifes of so many helpless outside there with this money.   \n\nMy Regards, \nFatima Zahra", "raw": "<hr>\n\n<span class=\"fz\">Fatima Zahra</span>\n<p class=\"st\">\n\n\nThu, 24 May 2007<br /><br /> \nMy Beloved Lewis D.
