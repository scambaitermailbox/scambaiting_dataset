Why should I deliberately delay a\ntransaction that will award me with US$41.5M ? Please give me only one\nunique reason explaining why I would behave that way. I need that money asap\nas I already wrote you.<br><br>\n\nI'm afraid YOU are delaying this transaction. I just request a photo of you\nholding a paper with SC AMORAMA NIGERIA LTD on it and I don't understand why\nyou refuse to send it.<br><br>\n\nI have been to the bank in Real Conio (Spain) where I'm currently and I've\nprepared the whole transaction with my bank in Paris. Now I've just to\ntelephone the bank and to give them the secret code and the money is wired.<br><br>\n\nHere is my LAST AND FINAL OFFER :<br>\nyou send the photo<br>\nat receipt I telephone the bank and give them the secret code so that they\nwire immediately Euro 22 875,00 to Mr. Williams' account<br><br>\n\nAdditionally, I've received an email from a Mr. ABAJA writing about a DEAD\nBANK CUSTOMER IN IVORY COAST who left US$35M on his bank account without any\nnext of kind to inherit the money. Mr. ABAJA wants only US$12,500 to get the\npapers showing I'm the sole and unique heir and it will be easy to get the\nmoney.<br><br>\n\nTherefore my dear Sabastine, if you want to stop this transaction right now\njust let me know. I'll not be mad against you and I'll forget all our\nemails.<br><br>\n\nThus don't worry for me : I'll get the money I need from Mr. Abaja anyway.<br><br>\n\nKind regards,<br><br>\n\nAdele Lepage nee Bow<br><br>\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "", "author_role": "scam", "body": "Mon, 4 Aug 2003 15:32:35 GMT\nX-Originating-IP: \n\nDear Adele,\n\nYou can go ahead with the so called Abaja, the simple thing is that you have\ntwo\nphotograph of me with you, so how come you find it very difficult to write\nthe\ncompany name and pest on any of them.

Conchita has brought me the laptop.\n\nI suspect Lepage just tried to kill me by emptying the swimming pool without\nwarning before I jumped in. Anyway I feel much better now.\n\nMind you that Lepage tried to wire money to an account in Africa.\nFortunately I have an agreement with Maria-Dolores Bocadillo who runs the\nbank office in Real Conio. She is a good friend of mine and she agreed to\ntelephone me every time Lepage tries to fiddle with the Association's\naccounts to check if I agree before proceeding. This time it was for Euro 22\n875,00 and of course I told Maria-Dolores not to wire the money and to tell\nLepage something was wrong with the bank details he gave.\n\nThus, and unfortunately, I can only suppose you are still in touch with\nLepage despite all my warnings about him being totally clueless about money.\nI can understand you because I have not emailed you due to my accident but\nit's time to restart on a firm basis. Once again please forget this old fool\nof Lepage who tried to kill me. He's becoming more and more strange speaking\nabout fish all the time with a weird light in his eyes. Conchita told me she\n's sometimes afraid of him. So please beware of Lepage, he could wreck our\ntransaction and send you insane emails.\n\nI had time to think while in the hospital. I've read magazines about Africa\nand Nigeria and understood you live in difficult conditions with all those\ncriminals, drug dealers and corrupted people around you. That's probably the\nreason why you emailed so different photos of you: you must be very cautious\nand protect your life, I can understand that and I forgive you.\n\nMy request is still the same: email me a real photo of you holding a paper\nwith SC AMORAMA NIGERIA LTD on it (of course not a photo made with a\ncomputer by copy/paste, it would be useless). That's the simplest way I can\nsee to be definitively sure you and Mr. Williams are the right people in the\nright place for this transaction. I will keep your photo strictly\nconfidential and will not ask for more evidence after I have received it.\n\nBest regards\nAdele Lepage nee Bow", "raw": "<hr><b><font color=\"green\">Adele (Mme.
