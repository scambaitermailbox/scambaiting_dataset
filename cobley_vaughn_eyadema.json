It\nhad a catalogue of errors in it. I listed them in previous emails to\nyou, but in case you missed them, here is a summary:\n\n++ First, the heading mis-spells the name of the Chief Justice.\n\n++ In the paragraph below that, the word \"Esq\" should be after\n   \"Adams Smith\" instead of after \"Smith Chambers\".\n\n++ In my address in section b, there should be commas to separate\n   the various elements. They should go between \"Cybus Corporation\"\n   and \"Park Royal\", between \"Industrial Estate\" and \"London\", and\n   also between \"NW10\" and \"England\". The address including commas\n   should be \"Cybus Corporation, Park Royal Industrial Estate,\n   London, NW10, England\". Alternatively, you may write each\n   logical element of the address on a separate line, as I did in\n   my original email to you.\n\n++ There should be a blank line between section b and section c.\n\n++ The grammar in section c is rather muddled and should be\n   re-written.  For example, the word \"originally\" should be moved\n   to before \"deposited\". The word \"the\" should be added between\n   \"by\" and \"late\", and the first letter of \"late\" should be in\n   lower case. Also, the word \"of\" should be added between\n   \"husband\" and \"Mrs.\"\n\n++ At the end of In section c, you wrote \"Accra Ghana\" with a\n   space as opposed to the the hyphenated \"Accra-Ghana\" that you\n   use everywhere else. Which version is correct?\n\n++ In sections c and d, you have added an extra full-stop (period)\n   in Sarah Kufa's name, writing it as \"Mrs. .Sarah Kufa\".  You\n   also have not used her full name, \"Mrs. Sarah Kufa Eyadema\".\n\n++ In section d, the phrase \"with reference to the next of kin\"\n   is meaningless and should be deleted since Mrs Eyadema is\n   already President Eyadema's next of kin and doesn't need to\n   refer anything to herself.\n\n++ Section d also refers to a \"public notary confirmed by the\n   institution\". Which institution is this? There is no other\n   mention of it anywhere in the document.\n\n++ The document goes straight from section d to section f without\n   any section e.\n\n++ Sections f and g are strangely indented for some reason, and\n   look very odd as a result.\n\n++ In section f, you say that the money will be paid into my bank\n   account in England.  If you had bothered to ask me, you would\n   know that I was planning to have it paid into my tax-free\n   offshore account in the Channel Islands, not England.\n\n++ Section g refers to \"the oaths act of 1963\". Firstly, \"Oaths\n   Act\" is a proper name and should have initial capital letters.\n   More importantly, this act is a Ghanaian law. Since we are\n   dealing with an international transaction between our two\n   countries, the affidavit needs to be valid under Ghanaian and\n   British laws. You need to extend this section so that it also\n   includes the relevant British act as well.\n\n++ At the bottom of the document, the phrase \"Commissioner of\n   Oath\" should be \"Commissioner of Oaths\".\n\n++ The Commissioner's signature appears to be written upside down\n   for some reason. On turning the paper round to read his\n   signature, I see that he has only written \"Stephen\" and nothing\n   more. Make sure he signs his full name next time and that he\n   is holding the paper the right way up.\n\n++ In the bottom right-hand corner of the document is a blue\n   stamp saying, \"Confirmed by Chief Justice Jenkins Diala.\n   Date....\" However, there is nothing written in the \"Date....\"\n   line to say when he confirmed it.\n\nIt is because of these errors that I commissioned a replacement\naffidavit from the Cybus Corporation Legal Department. I want to us\nproceed using my affidavit, not yours. Kindly let me know if this is\nacceptable.\n\nMy affidavit might not be as colourful as yours, but at least all the\nsignatures are the right way up, the grammar is correct, and there are\nno mysterious references to a non-existant public notary being\nconfirmed by a non-existant institution with reference to a\nnon-existant next of kin.\n\n\nTobias Vaughn, Cybercontroller\nCYBUS CORPORATION\n\n\n((I attached my improved affidavit again, just in case he had missed\nit the first time round))", "raw": "<hr>\n\n<span class=\"tv\">Tobias Vaughn</span><br><br><span class=\"ast\">\n\n\n\nTo: smithchamber_gh@hotmail.com\n<br><br>\nMr Smith\n<br><br>\nYou say that \"The payment is for cost of insurance and the cost of\nshipping fee, by the security and finance company.\"<br><br>\n\nCan you give me a detailed breakdown?
