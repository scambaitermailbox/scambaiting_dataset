Her mom died when she was five, and her dad got killed by her uncle and she's got this inheritance and... well, you know the rest. Anyway, Father Martin Voom, a priest for the Holy Order of Nakkara, is a generous man and wants to help.\n\n\nOf course, Tina is a scammer. But Father Voom isn't exactly a saint either; the Order of Nakkara is a cult devoted to the Cha; a race of dragon-like dark gods that require human breeding vessels.\n\n\nAnd Tina is Father Voom's next target.", "Text of conversion form:\nCHURCH OF THE HOLY ORDER OF NAKKARA\nTHIS AGREEMENT OF CONVERSION (hereinafter referred to as the \"Agreement\") made and entered into this day of _________, 2010, by and between The Church of the Holy Order of Nakkara (hereinafter referred to as \"Church\") and _________________________________ (hereinafter referred to as \"Convert\").\n\nWITNESSETH:\n\nWHEREAS, Church is desirous of accepting Convert for legal guardianship upon the terms and conditions as contained herein; and is desirous of leasing the Housing from Church on the terms and conditions as contained herein;\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:\n\n1. TERM. Church leases to Convert and Convert leases from Church the above described Premises together with any and all appurtenances thereto, for a term decided by Church.\n\n2. DEVOTION.

Convert shall not allow any other person, other than Convert's immediate family or transient relatives and friends who are guests of Convert, to use or occupy the Premises without first obtaining Church's written consent to such use. Convert shall comply with any and all laws, ordinances, rules and orders of any and all governmental or quasi-governmental authorities affecting the cleanliness, use, occupancy and preservation of the Premises.\n\n4. RITUALS. Convert will surrender both body and soul to the Cha, including, but not limited to, the use of Convert\u0081fs reproductive system to gestate the spawn of the Cha. Church will not be held responsible for physical or psychological damage related to pregnancy with inhuman offspring.\n\n5. AESTHETIC PREFERENCE.

FINAL AGREEMENT.
