A more honorable generous man I have never met.\nI am just on my way to visit Flee at St. Mungo's I will give him your regards and ask him how he wishes for me to proceed. Madame Pomfrey is bringing some of her fabulous Doxy ointment combined with this wonderful news he will be up and around back to normal in no time at all.
