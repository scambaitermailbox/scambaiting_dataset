I am a successful businessman and I'm sure we can solve your problem and move your money with very little effort. With your limited knowledge of these matters I need you to closely follow my advice. Do not do anything without asking me first. Do this, and we can probably have you and your money here by the middle of next month.\n\nNow, to start things off, what kind of documentation do you have for this account?

The hotel fax machine has been out of order for the past two months and the new one has not yet arrived from Murmansk so you'll have to scan and send as email attachments.\n\nI don't want you talking to any bankers yet.

I'll try and explain this as best I can.<br><br>\n\nFelix, you have consistently avoided discussing your personal development and I suspect that the reason is due to the fact that there has been no personal development. I don't think you're trying to change your lifestyle at all. You're probably still hanging around with that pastor all day, praying and talking about the river Jordan and stuff like that, right?<br><br>\n\nIt's like I told you before, I can't bring you here and have you underfoot praying all day and having people from your bible study group in and out at all hours. The next thing you know you'd be trying to drag me into that stuff. As it says in the book of Noogie, chapter 3, verse 17, \"Thou shalt enjoy your life to the maximum. Go ye therefore and debauche\". If it was a matter of you leaving your empty beer cans underfoot or dragging women in and out at all hours, THAT I could live with.\n<br><br>\nSorry, kiddo, but you need to find somebody else to help you with this. Best of luck to you.\n<br><br>\nLewd \n\n</span><br><br>\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "SIR I AM AGREED WITH YOU /DONT' WORRY", "author_role": "scam", "body": "Sat, 15 Oct 2005\n\n\nDEAR LEWD WHAT IS THE PROBLEM NOW?

They still have to send me their office phone number and address but I'm expecting it any time now. I'm ready to send them what we owe them in charges. I guess the only thing remaining is for you to make a decision.\n\nWhen I was working with your brother it was necessary for me to invest almost $3,500 of my own money for hotel living accomodations for a diplomat who never showed up. This was before Felix moved the money to Belgium. Goffin Group has informed me that I must now pay approximately 9,800 Euros, or about $12,000 in charges. I also probably need to send you some money to live in while we're getting everything finalized. I want to be very sure before I throw any more money at this thing.\n\nWhen I first discovered that your brother was a very religious person I told him it would be best if he found someone else to help him. I explained that I could not function living with someone who sat around praying and meditating all day, talking about things like Samson being swallowed by a whale. When your brother told me he had changed and no longer had any interest in religion, I asked him to send me a picture of himself with a girl sitting on his lap and holding a beer and a cigarette. He refused to do so.\n\nI suppose deep down I knew all along that he was lying when he said he had changed but it was his refusal to send me the picture that confirmed it. He was just too religious a person to be able to do something like that.\n\nI feel more confident with you, but only a little. While Barrister Martins told me that you had indeed tried alcohol to the point of over-consumption, I also asked you for the same picture which you have not provided.\n\nPeter my friend, I cannot take the chance of you coming here and not being able to fit in with the way I live. I don't want to go to all the effort to get you here and then have to send you back because we can't get along. I'm know you understand that I have to be reasonably confident that you're going to be able to adjust to my wild and crazy lifestyle.\n\nSo here's the deal - send me a picture of yourself, sitting, with a girl on your lap and a bottle of beer in one hand and a cigarette or cigar in the other. Just have a friend take the picture in your home or a club, it will cost you nothing. Seeing this picture will convince me of your character.\n\nI must warn you - if you give me some bogus excuse like you're afraid the picture will end up in a newspaper or on the internet, our deal is off. Nobody but me is interested in this picture.\n\nIf you tell me you don't know anyone with a camera, our deal is off. Everybody owns a camera.\n\nIf you tell me you can't find a girl to sit on your lap, our deal is off. You're a rich man, any girl would be happy to sit on your lap for a picture.\n\nBottom line, if you give me any excuse as to why you can't send me the picture I ask for, I will know you are not sincere and our deal is off.\n\nThis is a small thing I ask but it will prove so much to me. Please don't dissappoint me. Send me the picture and your whole life changes. Goffin Group will receive their money the same day I receive the picture. I will send you enough money to live on until we get your brother's estate in hand and I get your Russian visa arranged. Once we get you here with your money, you will live as a wealthy man. You'll have girlfriends, parties, and girlfriends! And parties!\n\nI want you to have a good start in life and I am the guy to give it to you. It's all up to you.\n\nLet me know. \nLewd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscamorama main street \n* \nget booked \n*", "raw": "<hr>\n\n<span class=\"lnc\">[It was one year ago today that I was first contacted by Felix Dunga.
