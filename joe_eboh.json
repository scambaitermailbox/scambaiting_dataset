She was almost immediately accepted by\nthem and was one of the most trusted westerners known at that time.\nIn her later years she returned to England and started her own\nministry Holy Church of The Order of The Red Breast and was very\nactive until her sad death in 1861.\nAs a qualification to enter the Holy Church of The Order of The\nRed Breast, all followers must go through the initiation procedure\nthat Miss Carrington made so famous. Of course in these modern times,\nfemale members do not have to paint their breast. They only need\nto make the symbol on their stomachs.

However, even in two installments as you advise, the total\nwithdrawal amount will be over $10,000 so the clearance fee has\nto be paid. Let me try to explain to you exactly how the church\nwithdrawal system works.\nAs an example, if I needed to withdraw $12,000 I would have to\npay the Clearance Fee. If I pay the clearance fee in anything other\nthan cash, I have to fill out another certificate which is called\na \"Usage & Certification certificate\". The Usage &\nCertification certificate states in great detail what the payment\nis to be used for. I have to get every stage of the payment stamped\nand authorised, and the money has to be proven to have been used\nfor the original purpose. The person to whom the money is being\nprovided MUST sign the Usage & Certification certificate IN\nPERSON at our church headquarters in London. This is an added security\nmeasure to ensure the payment is going to be used for its intended\npurpose.\nNow, if the Clearance Fee is paid in cash, then there is no need\nto complete the Usage & Certification certificate. Also, I do\nnot need to explain to the church committee for what purpose the\nfunds are for. This will give us both a much higher level of security\nas you have already advised me that it is vital that we keep this\nbusiness deal totally secret. If I have to complete the Usage &\nCertification certificate then there will be at least 23 other people\nwho will know about our plans.\nFor amounts under $10,000 a Clearance Fee is still required, and\nthe charge is dependent on the total amount required.\n\nSo you see brother Eboh, there is no way around the $80 Clearance\nFee I am afraid, and unless you are able to come to London to sign\nthe Usage & Certification certificate and you want to keep this\ndeal secret then you will have to send the fee in cash. If you can\ndo this, please let me know and I will forward you my private home\naddress so that we can ensure secrecy throughout.\n\nOnce I receive the Clearance Fee then the transfer if the $18,000.00\nwill take only a matter of a couple of hours.\n\nI hope that my explanation is clear for you my brother.\n\nTake care,\n\nFather Hector Barnett.\n\n\n", "from_name": "Father Hector Barnett", "raw": "            <p><b>From: Father Hector Barnett<br>\n              To: Prince Joe Eboh</b></p>\n            <p>Dear brother Joe,<br>\n              <br>\n              Thank you so much for your wonderful photograph and bless you for \n              your quick reply.<br>\n              <br>\n              My brother, the content of your email is fully understood, but I \n              must point out some things to you before we can proceed in this \n              deal.<br>\n              <br>\n              The total amount that you are requiring me to invest is $18,0000.00. \n              Now this is absolutely not a problem, and I can easily gather this \n              amount.

This will give us both a much higher level of security \n              as you have already advised me that it is vital that we keep this \n              business deal totally secret. If I have to complete the Usage &amp; \n              Certification certificate then there will be at least 23 other people \n              who will know about our plans.</p>\n            <p>For amounts under $10,000 a Clearance Fee is still required, and \n              the charge is dependent on the total amount required.<br>\n              <br>\n              So you see brother Eboh, there is no way around the $80 Clearance \n              Fee I am afraid, and unless you are able to come to London to sign \n              the Usage &amp; Certification certificate and you want to keep this \n              deal secret then you will have to send the fee in cash. If you can \n              do this, please let me know and I will forward you my private home \n              address so that we can ensure secrecy throughout.<br>\n              <br>\n              Once I receive the Clearance Fee then the transfer if the $18,000.00 \n              will take only a matter of a couple of hours.<br>\n              <br>\n              I hope that my explanation is clear for you my brother.<br>\n              <br>\n              Take care,<br>\n              <br>\n              Father Hector Barnett.</p>\n            <p>&nbsp;</p>\n"}, {"to_name": "", "author_role": "scam", "subject": "Re: Password: Pappa's Got a Brand New Bag", "comments": [], "date": "Wednesday, May 19, 2004 1:48 PM", "body": "Dear Father Hector,\n\nThanks for your swift reply.
