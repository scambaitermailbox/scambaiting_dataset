I saw your contact and I was attracted to contact you for assistance after much praying and feastings. Let me tell you more about myself. I am the only child to my late parents, I don\u00d5t have a brother or sister and I lost all my relatives in the middle of the war in my country, so after the war my family settled at the capital city of Abidjan before their sudden death. After the tragedy I took to my heels and ran for my dear life and I ended up here in this country refugee camp under the asistance of the united nation.\n\n\nFirstly i am writing you from the office of the Reverend Pastor. I explained my conditions to him and he allowed me to access my email in his office. Ever since my arrival to this camp, I had been suffering so much here and now I had taken the decision to go and meet with the bank to know the process of getting the money transferred as I am the next of kin to my father. It was during my discussion with the bank that they told me that I must look for a foreigner who will help me due to my status as a refugee and the agreement with my father. So I have to pray to God and after my praying and fasting God directed me to contact you. I was browsing on the internet when I came across your email and I was touched to contact you for assistance. I sent you my proposal to assist me over the transfer of this fund because I had stayed long here in this camp and I don\u00d5t want to continue like this, I am just like a person who is staying in a prison yard.\n\n\nPlease dear what I need from you now is just your assurance that you will assist me and will not betray me after receiving the money in your account. Once I gets your assurance I will give you the contact of the bank were the money was deposited so that you can contact them for the procedure of the transfer. Please dear I want you to know that I am suffering so much here in this camp and I don\u00d5t have any body to help me except you. I am putting all my hope and trust in you. I am just an innocent orphan perishing here in this camp and I am pleading for your assistance. Once I receives your mail I will send you the bank information and I will also tell the bank about you so that they will reply to one when you contacts them.\n\n\nSo my dear, I want you to feel free and help me on this matter and I assure you that you will not regret helping me. I am suffering so much here in this camp and I don\u00d5t want to continue like this, I need my freedom so that I can come out of this place and live a better life with you and hopefully go back to my studies.
