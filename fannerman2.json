Don't\nworry, I have told your brother that I will be writing\nto you, so you need not fear. Your words were as a\nsweet bouquet to my eyes. No one has ever called me\n\"darling\" before, and I must tell you, my sweetest\ngirl, it was thrilling to hear it. I feel as if I have\nknown you my whole life. \nYou see, Josephine, I have been so lonely. I have\nspent my whole life up to this point only thinking of\nmoney... how to get it, and then how to get more. I\nnever even had any real friends, because I was always\ntoo busy cooking up new business schemes, investing\nand re-investing my earnings, always counting,\ncounting, counting... \nPlease try not to think badly of me because of this.\nHowever, the result of all my labours has been a full\nbank account, and an empty heart... full moon and\nempty arms.\nLast year I celebrated my arrival at a certain\nfinancial milestone by purchasing a 36 (THIRTY SIX)\nfoot Chris\nCraft cabin cruiser boat, which I keep docked at the\nMiami Seaquarium. (Please don't think I am bragging or\nshowing off! I know, sweet Josephine,  that you would\nnever determine a person's value by the number of\nmaterial possessions he may have, or the size of his\nbank account. Please do not feel insulted!) \nI thought this vessel would bring me happiness, but do\nyou want to know something, my dearest Josephine? It\nhas only brought me emptiness! Where is the joy when\nthere is no one to share one's good fortune?!\nSometimes I feel like a motherless child, like the\npoorest beggar, when I see an ordinary family walking\nin the street enjoying each other's company, even if\nthey are dressed in rags! I would give everything up\nin an instant, give up my homes and everything else to\nthe meek and destitute, if only I could find happiness\nlike that.\nIs this making sense? I hope you do not mind that I\npour my deepest, most heartfelt feelings out to you.

I have seen pictures, and\neven saw a part of a film once, until I realized what\nwas happening and I ran out! It all seemed so strange\nto me.

Don't\nworry, I have told your brother that I will be writing\nto you, so you need not fear. Your words were as a\nsweet bouquet to my eyes. No one has ever called me\n\"darling\" before, and I must tell you, my sweetest\ngirl, it was thrilling to hear it. I feel as if I have\nknown you my whole life. </P>\n\n<P>You see, Josephine, I have been so lonely. I have\nspent my whole life up to this point only thinking of\nmoney... how to get it, and then how to get more. I\nnever even had any real friends, because I was always\ntoo busy cooking up new business schemes, investing\nand re-investing my earnings, always counting,\ncounting, counting... </P>\n\n<P>Please try not to think badly of me because of this.\nHowever, the result of all my labours has been a full\nbank account, and an empty heart... full moon and\nempty arms.</P>\n\n<P>Last year I celebrated my arrival at a certain\nfinancial milestone by purchasing a 36 (THIRTY SIX)\nfoot Chris\nCraft cabin cruiser boat, which I keep docked at the\nMiami Seaquarium. (Please don't think I am bragging or\nshowing off! I know, sweet Josephine,  that you would\nnever determine a person's value by the number of\nmaterial possessions he may have, or the size of his\nbank account. Please do not feel insulted!) </P>\n\n<P>I thought this vessel would bring me happiness, but do\nyou want to know something, my dearest Josephine? It\nhas only brought me emptiness! Where is the joy when\nthere is no one to share one's good fortune?!\nSometimes I feel like a motherless child, like the\npoorest beggar, when I see an ordinary family walking\nin the street enjoying each other's company, even if\nthey are dressed in rags! I would give everything up\nin an instant, give up my homes and everything else to\nthe meek and destitute, if only I could find happiness\nlike that.</P>\n\n<P>Is this making sense? I hope you do not mind that I\npour my deepest, most heartfelt feelings out to you. I\nonly wish we could be together, with your head resting\nnext to my heart, gazing up at me with your beautiful\nbrown eyes. Oh my dearest Josephine, forgive me for\nspeaking to you like this.

I hope all this comes\nto pass. But we will know more when we meet in\nAbidjan. After all, we do not really know each other\nat all yet. Maybe you will not like me when you see\nme. But I can assure you that I am a good-looking\nhealthy man. \nI want you to know that I will be leaving on the 15th\nof April. I will arrive there in the evening of that\ndate. I will inform you of the particulars in the next\nday or so, but the date is definitely fixed. As Hillie\nhas not yet told me how many days he expects it to\ntake to acquire the contents of the box, I am buying\nan\"open return\" ticket. This way, if we really think\nwe are meant for each other, we can spend some extra\ntime together. This is an advantage to owning a\ncompany...there is no boss I must answer to, and my\ntime is my own.\nNow I must tell you something which I hope will not\ncause you to have second thoughts about a possible\nmarriage with me. I know that you are Christian, and I\nhave great respect for the Christian religion. But, my\ndearest Josephine, I am Jewish.\n\nMy ancestors come from Bialystock, Poland. My paternal\ngrandfather was named Itzik  Diddowitzsteinkovsky, a\nvery common name in the region, but not very appealing\nto Americans. Upon his arrival in the USA, he\nshortened the name to Diddy, to suit American life and\ntastes. I want you to know everything about my family,\nand when we see each other, I will tell you more about\nour history.\nIn order for us to be married, you must convert to\nJudaism, the Israelite-Hebrew religion. As you know,\nJesus Christ was Jewish. If He were alive today, He\nwould give us His blessing. Remember, Jesus Christ did\nnot know about \"Christianity\", as it did not yet\nexist. He was a yeshiva bocher. Let me tell you what\nthis means for us, stating only the most important\nparticulars, which you must know beforehand:\nWe will keep a \"kosher\" household. We will eat no\npork, nor fish without scales (sharks, eels, etc). We \nwill not eat any food which contains oats, barley, \nmalt, spelt, or milt. Any water we drink must be \nheated to 42 (FORTY TWO) degrees Celsius. We may \neat foods of any colours except yellow (no bananas). \nWe will not eat any dairy products with meat at the \nsame meal. Any animal we eat must not be slaughtered \nin a cruel fashion, but must die painlessly by lethal \ninjection.You can read all these injunctions in the \nbible, for example, concerning the meat and dairy: \n\"Thou shalt not boil a kid in its mother's milk.\" \nWe will go to the \"synagogue\", the House of Worship, 3\ntimes each day. You will look down from behind a\nscreen in the women's gallery, where you will get to\nknow all the other wives of the congregation. \n\nWhenever you have your monthly menstruation\n(\"period\"), you will remain apart from me at a \ndistance of at least 60 (SIXTY) cubits, and be careful\n\nnot to touch me. When your menstruation is complete, \nyou will go to the \"mikveh\", the ritual bathhouse, and\n\nclean yourself. Then you can come home to me and we \nwill have intimate relations.\nAs far as these intimate relations are concerned, it\nis forbidden for us to gaze upon the naked body of the\nother. Therefore, when we do have intimate relations,\nyou will cover yourself with a special sheet which has\na circular hole cut in it at the appropriate place. In\nthis way, we will be able to have children without\ndegrading ourselves by close physical contact. While\nhaving these relations, we will think only of holy\nthings, and not behave lustfully or in a jocular\nfashion. Do not be offended, my dearest girl. One must\nspeak directly about such things, so there will be no\nmisunderstandings later.\nYou must, the day we are married, remove all the hair\nfrom your head and body. In place of your natural\nhair, you will wear a wig. This is for purposes of\nmodesty, so no other man may look with a lustful heart\nupon your own hair. You will dress so that your body\nis covered down to your ankles, and so that your arms\nand ears are covered as well.\nYou will learn to prepare suitable dishes for our\nfamily to eat. This includes, but is not limited to:\n\nGefilte fish with sliced carrots and horse radish,\nstuffed kishke, tzimmes, borscht with sour cream,\nbrisket, boiled chicken, hamentashen, challah (braided\nfor shabbos), kugel, noodle pudding (mmm!), and honey\ncake.\nPlease do not be alarmed. You will be relieved to know\nthat my mother's 3 sisters will oversee your every\nmove, and carefully teach you how best to accomplish\nall that will be necessary.\nPlease understand, dearest Josephine, the importance\nattached to these matters. I would encourage you to\npick up a copy of the \"Kitzur Shulchan Aruch\" by Rabbi\nSolomon Ganzfried at your local bookstore there in\nAbidjan. In it you will find all the necessary\ninstructions for maintaining a proper kosher\nhousehold, and for leading a \"frum\" (holy) life. I\nwould not want to spring these matters on you by\nsurprise, so it is best that you prepare yourself for\nthis, so that you may make an informed decision. If\nthere is true love, everything else will follow.\nPlease inform Hillie that I am in touch with the\ngentleman at the security company, and we are making\narrangements for the speedy transfer of the approval\nfee, which will be no problem as long as I have the\nproper document. I hope the security company is\nreliable, so I can send the money as quickly as\npossible. I have already withdrawn it from the company\ntreasury, but cannot send it there until I have the\npaperwork which will enable me to attach it to a\npurchase order. This may sound complicated to you,\ndearest Josephine, but I assure you it is a simple\nmatter, and is done every day.\n\nMy company, \"BLUE CRESCENT EAT-M-UP WIGGLE BABY\nPLASTIC WORMS, INC.\" is a manufacturer of fishing\nequipment and artificial baits. It is well known in\nthe USA. All the profit money from the security box\nwill go into its bank account, after, of course, we\ntake a small advance for expenses and other\n\"necessities\"...only a few hundred thousand dollars...\n:)  . Don't worry, my sweet girl, I am basically an\nhonest man, who has achieved a high station in life\nthrough hard work.\nDearest Josephine, it is IMPERATIVE that you write to\nme IMMEDIATELY and tell me whether you feel you can\ncomply with my wishes, so I will feel free to complete\nthis transaction with a heart full of gladness at the\nanticipated outcome.\n\nLove\n\nYour Diddy", "raw": "<hr>\n<B><P><FONT  COLOR=\"purple\">ARNOLD to \"JOSEPHINE\"</FONT></P></B>\n\nDearest Josephine,<br>\n<P>It was thrilling to receive your letter, and to see\nyou sign it \"Josephine Diddy\".

This includes, but is not limited to:\n<BR><BR>\nGefilte fish with sliced carrots and horse radish,\nstuffed kishke, tzimmes, borscht with sour cream,\nbrisket, boiled chicken, hamentashen, challah (braided\nfor shabbos), kugel, noodle pudding (mmm!), and honey\ncake.</P>\n\n<P>Please do not be alarmed. You will be relieved to know\nthat my mother's 3 sisters will oversee your every\nmove, and carefully teach you how best to accomplish\nall that will be necessary.</P>\n\n<P>Please understand, dearest Josephine, the importance\nattached to these matters. I would encourage you to\npick up a copy of the \"Kitzur Shulchan Aruch\" by Rabbi\nSolomon Ganzfried at your local bookstore there in\nAbidjan. In it you will find all the necessary\ninstructions for maintaining a proper kosher\nhousehold, and for leading a \"frum\" (holy) life. I\nwould not want to spring these matters on you by\nsurprise, so it is best that you prepare yourself for\nthis, so that you may make an informed decision. If\nthere is true love, everything else will follow.</P>\n\n<P>Please inform Hillie that I am in touch with the\ngentleman at the security company, and we are making\narrangements for the speedy transfer of the approval\nfee, which will be no problem as long as I have the\nproper document. I hope the security company is\nreliable, so I can send the money as quickly as\npossible. I have already withdrawn it from the company\ntreasury, but cannot send it there until I have the\npaperwork which will enable me to attach it to a\npurchase order. This may sound complicated to you,\ndearest Josephine, but I assure you it is a simple\nmatter, and is done every day.\n</P>\n<P>My company, \"BLUE CRESCENT EAT-M-UP WIGGLE BABY\nPLASTIC WORMS, INC.\" is a manufacturer of fishing\nequipment and artificial baits. It is well known in\nthe USA. All the profit money from the security box\nwill go into its bank account, after, of course, we\ntake a small advance for expenses and other\n\"necessities\"...only a few hundred thousand dollars...\n:)  . Don't worry, my sweet girl, I am basically an\nhonest man, who has achieved a high station in life\nthrough hard work.</P>\n\n<P>Dearest Josephine, it is IMPERATIVE that you write to\nme IMMEDIATELY and tell me whether you feel you can\ncomply with my wishes, so I will feel free to complete\nthis transaction with a heart full of gladness at the\nanticipated outcome.</P>\n\nLove<br><br>\n\nYour Diddy<br> \n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "", "author_role": "scam", "body": "MY DEAREST DIDDY,\n  I RECEIVED YOUR MAIL WITH ULTIMATE HAPPINESS.IT\nDOES NOT MATTER THE KIND OF RELIGION YOU ARE BUT WHAT\nMATTERS IS THE LOVE WE HAVE FOR EACH OTHER.AS YOU MAY\nKNOW,OUR PARENTS ARE NOT ALIVE BUT WHAT I NEED IS YOUR\nCARING WHICH I KNOW YOU CARES.\n ON THE OTHER SIDE,KNOW SO WELL THAT LOVE IS BLIND,IT\nDOES NOT MATTER HOW YOU LOOK PHYSICALLY,SPIRITUALLY\nAND OTHERWISE BUT RATHER THE LOVE OF GOD WHICH MY\nPARENTS TAUGHT ME BEFORE THEIR UNTIMELY DEATH.BE REST\nASSURED THAT I LOVE YOU FROM THE DIPPEST OF MY HEART\nNO MATTER HOW YOU LOOK LIKE.\n  LIKE I SAID IN MY MAIL TO YOU,I HAVE BEEN HAVING\nSLEEPLESS NIGHT WAITING FOR YOUR ARREIVAL NOW,I AM A\nBITE RELEIVED FROM THE DATE YOU GAVE ME,GIVE ME YOUR\nFLIGHT SCHEDULE FOR ME TO GET PREPARED AND WAIT FOR\nYOU AT THE AIRPORT.PLEASE,I WILL LIKE YOU TO SEND ME\nSOME MONEY FOR ME TO USE TO BUY THE BOOK YOU ASKED ME\nTO BUY SO AS TO START STUDING IT.I WILL BE GREATFUL TO\nRECEIVE THE MONEY.\n FURTHERMORE,ON THE SIDE OF THE SECURITY COMPANY,THEY\nARE RELIABLE,THEY DO NOT  KNOW WHAT MY LATE FATHER\nDEPOSITED IN THE BOX PLEASE, DO NOT TELL THEM(IT IS\nMONEY)ANYTHING THEY ASK YOU TO DO,DO IT AS WE ARE\nEXPECTING YOUR ARRIEVAL.I WILL  INFORM HILARY TO EMAIL\nYOU THE DOCUMENTS OF DEPOSIT AND ALL THE NECESSIARY\nDOCUMENTS RELATING TO THE DEPOSITED BOX.PLEASE DO SEND\nTO THEM WHAT THEY NEEDED FROM YOU FASTER SO AS TO\nCLAIM THE BOX FOR OUR MUTUAL BENEFIT IN INVESTING IN\nYOUR COMPANY.I WILL LIKE TO REMIND YOU THAT AFTER OUR\nMARRIAGE,I WILL TAKE THE POSSITION OF THE DEPUTY\nDIRECTOR IN ASSISTING YOU IN THE COMPANY.\n\n I AM WAITING FOR YOUR REPLY IMMEDIATELY.\n\n YOUR LOVE,\nJOSEPHINE DIDDY.", "raw": "<hr>\n<B><P><FONT  color=\"red\">\"JOSEPHINE\" to ARNOLD</FONT></P></B>\n\nMY DEAREST DIDDY,<br><br>\n\n<P>  I RECEIVED YOUR MAIL WITH ULTIMATE HAPPINESS.IT\nDOES NOT MATTER THE KIND OF RELIGION YOU ARE BUT WHAT\nMATTERS IS THE LOVE WE HAVE FOR EACH OTHER.AS YOU MAY\nKNOW,OUR PARENTS ARE NOT ALIVE BUT WHAT I NEED IS YOUR\nCARING WHICH I KNOW YOU CARES.</P>\n\n<P> ON THE OTHER SIDE,KNOW SO WELL THAT LOVE IS BLIND,IT\nDOES NOT MATTER HOW YOU LOOK PHYSICALLY,SPIRITUALLY\nAND OTHERWISE BUT RATHER THE LOVE OF GOD WHICH MY\nPARENTS TAUGHT ME BEFORE THEIR UNTIMELY DEATH.BE REST\nASSURED THAT I LOVE YOU FROM THE DIPPEST OF MY HEART\nNO MATTER HOW YOU LOOK LIKE.</P>\n\n<P>  LIKE I SAID IN MY MAIL TO YOU,I HAVE BEEN HAVING\nSLEEPLESS NIGHT WAITING FOR YOUR ARREIVAL NOW,I AM A\nBITE RELEIVED FROM THE DATE YOU GAVE ME,GIVE ME YOUR\nFLIGHT SCHEDULE FOR ME TO GET PREPARED AND WAIT FOR\nYOU AT THE AIRPORT.PLEASE,I WILL LIKE YOU TO SEND ME\nSOME MONEY FOR ME TO USE TO BUY THE BOOK YOU ASKED ME\nTO BUY SO AS TO START STUDING IT.I WILL BE GREATFUL TO\nRECEIVE THE MONEY.</P>\n\n<P> FURTHERMORE,ON THE SIDE OF THE SECURITY COMPANY,THEY\nARE RELIABLE,THEY DO NOT  KNOW WHAT MY LATE FATHER\nDEPOSITED IN THE BOX PLEASE, DO NOT TELL THEM(IT IS\nMONEY)ANYTHING THEY ASK YOU TO DO,DO IT AS WE ARE\nEXPECTING YOUR ARRIEVAL.I WILL  INFORM HILARY TO EMAIL\nYOU THE DOCUMENTS OF DEPOSIT AND ALL THE NECESSIARY\nDOCUMENTS RELATING TO THE DEPOSITED BOX.PLEASE DO SEND\nTO THEM WHAT THEY NEEDED FROM YOU FASTER SO AS TO\nCLAIM THE BOX FOR OUR MUTUAL BENEFIT IN INVESTING IN\nYOUR COMPANY.I WILL LIKE TO REMIND YOU THAT AFTER OUR\nMARRIAGE,I WILL TAKE THE POSSITION OF THE DEPUTY\nDIRECTOR IN ASSISTING YOU IN THE COMPANY.</P>\n\n I AM WAITING FOR YOUR REPLY IMMEDIATELY.\n<br>\n YOUR LOVE,<br>\nJOSEPHINE DIDDY.<br>\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "Denouement!", "author_role": "bait", "body": "Of course I did not give any real id!

So I shall do\n                  this. Have no fear, I will bring the cash with me on\n                  the 15th or my name is not P. Diddy!

"", "author_role": "bait", "body": "Dearest Dearling Josephine, Dear Girl:\n           I have received your letter with gladness. But now I\n                  have upset you! Do not worry one little bit, sweet\n                  girl. I assure you the security company will get the\n                  money. A few days delay is of no matter. Remember, I\n                  can stay there with you for as long as I like, so even\n                  if I give the approval fee after I arrive there, we\n                  can wait for it to be processed and then I can pay the\n                  demurrage and claim the trunk. I only do this at the\n                  request of our treasurer at Wiggle Baby. It is\n                  nothing. 5550 dollars is a very small amount, though\n                  it may seem large for you, who is in such dire\n                  straits. But with a view to the final amount, which is\n                  not so small, it is important that everything be done\n                  so as not to make waves in the company. This means\n                  that I must be able to say to the treasurer, \"Yes I\n                  have met everyone, and they are all decent people.\" I\n                  can do this even before we leave the airport. I am\n                  sending a letter to Dr. Ozondu to explain everything.\n         The only thing that would make me send the money now\n                  is if you told me that you will not marry me if I do\n                  not do it, and of course you will not do that! Our\n                  love is far too deep and lasting for such a thought.\n          You mentioned in your letter that Dr. Ozondu wants to\n                  take you out of the camp. Why would he say such a\n                  thing? I hope there is nothing more than a purely\n                  business relationship between you, though I am happy\n                  that he has been kind to you. I do get a bit jealous,\n                  so I worry when I read such things.\n    Please, dear Josephine, tell me what size dress you\n                  wear, so I can stop off at a store called \"Victoria's\n                  Secret\" and buy some presents for you. I want to buy\n                  so many nice things for you, so do tell me what you\n                  like. Do you like jewelry? In America it is the custom\n                  for a man to buy his woman gifts of gold and diamonds,\n                  especially when they are to be married. Please go to a\n                  jewelry store and look at some things. If you see\n                  something you like, just tell me what it is, and I\n                  will bring something of the same type and quality. I\n                  would love to wrap  something around your neck as soon\n                  as I see you.\n         Again...please tell me your dress size. And tell me\n                  what type of jewelry you like. Do not worry about the\n                  price.\n         Dearest Josephine, please describe conditions at the\n                  camp for me. I want to know everything about your\n                  living conditions. If things are really bad there,\n                  perhaps I should help you before I get there. Please\n                  describe every little thing to me. Please be as\n                  detailed as possible, so I can have an idea of exactly\n                  how you are living now. Describe your house, your\n                  neighbors, your street, the food you eat, the water,\n                  everything. I want you to tell me what a typical day\n                  in your life is like.\n         Try not to worry. Everything will reach a happy\n                  conclusion. By the way, \"ZEI GEZUND\" is a Jewish\n                  expression for \"farewell\".

"author_role": "bait", "body": "Dearest Josephine,\n    How are you today? I was overjoyed to hear from you\n                  again! Yes I have been very busy. As I expect to be in\n                  Abidjan for some time, I have much business to finish\n                  before leaving. Blue Crescent Wiggle Baby is a very\n                  large company, and it is not a simple matter for the\n                  director (me) to be away for any length of time, so I\n                  have been seeing to some important affairs.\n    I have also been shopping for you and Hillie. You\n                  mentioned that you like watches and gold jewelry, so I\n                  have purchased several of each. I bought you and\n                  Hillie each 2 (two) watches, for a total of 4 (four).\n                  You probably are not familiar with theses names, but I\n                  bought several kinds. One is called \"Rolex\". It is\n                  very beautiful. In fact, before I went to the store, I\n                  never knew how beautiful a watch could be! It is very\n                  elegant. I also bought a \"Piaget\" watch for you. It\n                  looks more like a piece of jewelry than a watch! It is\n                  made of white gold with small diamonds and rubies\n                  around it. I can't wait to see your face when you see\n                  it! Believe me, dearest Josephine, your life will be\n                  changing very soon. You will want to throw away\n                  everything you wore before you met me. Soon you will\n                  forget that you were ever in a camp.\n For Hillie, I bought a very large \"Patek Philippe\"\n                  watch, which I hope he will not think is too heavy. I\n                  am sure these names mean nothing to you, but I assure\n                  you they are well known watches, and are exquisite in\n                  appearance. I also bought a \"Rolex\" for Hillie.\n    I won't tell you about the other items I bought for\n                  you because I want to surprise you when we meet. I\n                  also got you a selection of dresses, but it is\n                  difficult to buy clothes for someone when they are not\n                  there with you, so if you do not mind, we will wait\n                  until I get there to buy more clothes. It is better\n                  that way.\n I hope you do not mind, my dear girl, but I told my\n                  Rabbi (Jewish priest) about you. He is very happy for\n                  us. I never told you this, but I, along with several\n                  other families, personally provided the funds to build\n                  the Temple of Solomon here in Miami. You cannot\n                  imagine the pride I feel when I attend the daily\n                  sacrifices there. It is a beautiful ceremony,\n                  especially when the Levites begin to sing. As the\n                  Diddy family goes back to the Kohanim (priests) of\n                  Jerusalem, we are entitled to a share in the Terumah\n                  (priest's share). After out marriage, we will go to\n                  the Temple and offer a bullock for sacrifice. We will\n                  join hands and sprinkle some blood upon the altar,\n                  then we will go home and feast on the Terumah. You\n                  will love it, I am sure. I will have a professional\n                  photographer make a video of the whole ceremony.\n\n      Well that's it for now, dearest Josephine. Please\n                  write soon. Dr. Uzondu has written to me and says that\n                  it will be ok for me to pay the approval fee when I\n                  arrive. This is a sure sign that everything will work\n                  out as planned.\n\n                  All my love\n\n                  Your Diddy", "raw": "<hr>\n<B><P><FONT  COLOR=\"purple\">ARNOLD to \"JOSEPHINE\"</FONT></P></B>\n\n\n                  Dearest Josephine,<br><br>\n\n              <P>    How are you today? I was overjoyed to hear from you\n                  again! Yes I have been very busy. As I expect to be in\n                  Abidjan for some time, I have much business to finish\n                  before leaving. Blue Crescent Wiggle Baby is a very\n                  large company, and it is not a simple matter for the\n                  director (me) to be away for any length of time, so I\n                  have been seeing to some important affairs.</P>\n\n              <P>    I have also been shopping for you and Hillie. You\n                  mentioned that you like watches and gold jewelry, so I\n                  have purchased several of each. I bought you and\n                  Hillie each 2 (two) watches, for a total of 4 (four).\n                  You probably are not familiar with theses names, but I\n                  bought several kinds. One is called \"Rolex\". It is\n                  very beautiful. In fact, before I went to the store, I\n                  never knew how beautiful a watch could be! It is very\n                  elegant. I also bought a \"Piaget\" watch for you. It\n                  looks more like a piece of jewelry than a watch! It is\n                  made of white gold with small diamonds and rubies\n                  around it. I can't wait to see your face when you see\n                  it! Believe me, dearest Josephine, your life will be\n                  changing very soon. You will want to throw away\n                  everything you wore before you met me. Soon you will\n                  forget that you were ever in a camp.</P>\n\n                 <P> For Hillie, I bought a very large \"Patek Philippe\"\n                  watch, which I hope he will not think is too heavy. I\n                  am sure these names mean nothing to you, but I assure\n                  you they are well known watches, and are exquisite in\n                  appearance. I also bought a \"Rolex\" for Hillie.</P>\n\n              <P>    I won't tell you about the other items I bought for\n                  you because I want to surprise you when we meet. I\n                  also got you a selection of dresses, but it is\n                  difficult to buy clothes for someone when they are not\n                  there with you, so if you do not mind, we will wait\n                  until I get there to buy more clothes.

"subject": "", "author_role": "bait", "body": "My Dearest Josephine,\n    Your letter was wonderful, as all your letters are. I\n                  have just been to the barber shop to get a nice\n                  haircut so I will look my best when we meet. I have\n                  even oiled my payes (earlocks), and bought a new\n                  tzitzit and a nice blue knitted yamulkeh just for you.\n                  I have been packing my suitcases, and am almost ready\n                  for the flight. I am shaking all over with\n                  excitement...excitement at meeting you, and of course\n                  excitement at the thought of all the money we will\n                  soon have for ourselves and our life together.\n       Do not worry, I will not mention anything about the\n                  money to Dr. Uzondu. You know I always had a good\n                  business sense. I always know what to do with people\n                  as far as business is concerned. Many times, business\n                  deals are presented to me which are not really\n                  suitable, and I have a 6th (SIXTH) sense about such\n                  things. This way I avoid difficulties, and only\n                  concern myself with solid transactions and solid\n                  people. For example, I know that you and Hillie are\n                  100% (ONE HUNDRED PERCENT) solid people, reliable and\n                  trustworthy. \n     Some people might have difficulty ascertaining such\n                  things, but I have a gift for spotting sincere\n                  individuals. If a person is unreliable, or even\n                  dishonest, I can tell right away, even before I meet\n                  them! I hope you do not think I am bragging, but it is\n                  the truth, my dearest Josephine. When you say that you\n                  are on my side, I know deep in my heart that nothing\n                  bad could ever happen to me. I am indeed fortunate to\n                  have found such honest and supportive individuals as\n                  you and Hillie!\n       You mentioned that you will be cooking beef and rice\n                  for us. That is my favorite dish, after \n                  chicken grieven with oyster sauce! But my dear, we\n                  could just as easily go to a restaurant. However, if\n                  you would like to show me how well you can cook, it\n                  will be my pleasure to partake of such a meal. I am\n                  sure it will be delicious!\nI only have one small request... you know, I travel\n                  frequently on business. But I am certainly never met\n                  at the airport by a lovely woman! In fact, I usually\n                  arrive alone, with no one at all to meet and greet me.\n                  When I see other people met by their loved ones, and\n                  presented with flowers, I always wish that it could be\n                  me! So, if you only could, will you meet me with a\n                  large bouquet of flowers? I do not mean a few little\n                  blossoms, but a big, colourful bouquet containing\n                  dozens of bright, fresh flowers. If it is a question\n                  of money, do not worry, I will more than repay you for\n                  this slight expense. But it would mean so much to me!!\n                  If it is absolutely impossible, I will understand. But\n                  if you could do this one small thing for me, I would\n                  see that your love for me is truly deep and that you\n                  are a caring person. Please do not tell me \"yes\" or\n                  \"no\" in an email. Just surprise me!! I am just so\n                  excited, my dearest girl. Nothing like this has ever\n                  happened to me, and I know I will remember the date\n                  April 16, 2002 for the rest of my life. I know that\n                  you will, too!\n\n I am impressed that Dr. Uzondu has managed to relocate\n                  you and Hillie to a better domicile. Did he outlay any\n                  money to pay for the new house? As your husband, I\n                  cannot allow this, and I insist upon repaying him for\n                  any expenses he may have incurred in moving you to the\n                  new home.

I\n                  have just been to the barber shop to get a nice\n                  haircut so I will look my best when we meet. I have\n                  even oiled my payes (earlocks), and bought a new\n                  tzitzit and a nice blue knitted yamulkeh just for you.\n                  I have been packing my suitcases, and am almost ready\n                  for the flight. I am shaking all over with\n                  excitement...excitement at meeting you, and of course\n                  excitement at the thought of all the money we will\n                  soon have for ourselves and our life together.</P>\n\n           <P>       Do not worry, I will not mention anything about the\n                  money to Dr. Uzondu. You know I always had a good\n                  business sense. I always know what to do with people\n                  as far as business is concerned. Many times, business\n                  deals are presented to me which are not really\n                  suitable, and I have a 6th (SIXTH) sense about such\n                  things. This way I avoid difficulties, and only\n                  concern myself with solid transactions and solid\n                  people. For example, I know that you and Hillie are\n                  100% (ONE HUNDRED PERCENT) solid people, reliable and\n                  trustworthy. </P>\n\n             <P>     Some people might have difficulty ascertaining such\n                  things, but I have a gift for spotting sincere\n                  individuals. If a person is unreliable, or even\n                  dishonest, I can tell right away, even before I meet\n                  them! I hope you do not think I am bragging, but it is\n                  the truth, my dearest Josephine. When you say that you\n                  are on my side, I know deep in my heart that nothing\n                  bad could ever happen to me. I am indeed fortunate to\n                  have found such honest and supportive individuals as\n                  you and Hillie!</P>\n\n           <P>       You mentioned that you will be cooking beef and rice\n                  for us. That is my favorite dish, after \n                  chicken grieven with oyster sauce! But my dear, we\n                  could just as easily go to a restaurant. However, if\n                  you would like to show me how well you can cook, it\n                  will be my pleasure to partake of such a meal. I am\n                  sure it will be delicious!</P>\n\n                  <P>I only have one small request... you know, I travel\n                  frequently on business. But I am certainly never met\n                  at the airport by a lovely woman! In fact, I usually\n                  arrive alone, with no one at all to meet and greet me.\n                  When I see other people met by their loved ones, and\n                  presented with flowers, I always wish that it could be\n                  me! So, if you only could, will you meet me with a\n                  large bouquet of flowers? I do not mean a few little\n                  blossoms, but a big, colourful bouquet containing\n                  dozens of bright, fresh flowers. If it is a question\n                  of money, do not worry, I will more than repay you for\n                  this slight expense. But it would mean so much to me!!\n                  If it is absolutely impossible, I will understand. But\n                  if you could do this one small thing for me, I would\n                  see that your love for me is truly deep and that you\n                  are a caring person. Please do not tell me \"yes\" or\n                  \"no\" in an email. Just surprise me!! I am just so\n                  excited, my dearest girl. Nothing like this has ever\n                  happened to me, and I know I will remember the date\n                  April 16, 2002 for the rest of my life. I know that\n                  you will, too!\n</P>\n                 <P> I am impressed that Dr. Uzondu has managed to relocate\n                  you and Hillie to a better domicile. Did he outlay any\n                  money to pay for the new house? As your husband, I\n                  cannot allow this, and I insist upon repaying him for\n                  any expenses he may have incurred in moving you to the\n                  new home. Please let me know how much he has spent, so\n                  I can immediately give him the money, without having\n                  to ask him how much he paid. I hope you understand\n                  this, but it is a question of honour.\n</P>\n                <P>  I am a little concerned about going through airport\n                  customs with all the valuable watches, jewelry, and\n                  cash I will be carrying.

He is told that if only\nhe will help to get the cash out of the country he\nwill win a percentage of the money, several million\ndollars. He agrees, and is told he must pay a fee,\nsay, $5550 (FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY US\nDOLLARS), to set the \"transaction\" in motion.\nHe travels to Africa and is welcomed with great\nfriendliness. But he finds that he also must pay the\n\"demurrage\" on the trunk... a huge amount of money.\nBut since he thinks the trunk contains millions, and\nsince he has already paid thousands of dollars, he\nreluctantly pays the fee on the trunk.\nHe is treated royally by his hosts, he is taken to\nnice restaurants (which he pays for), and smiles are\nthe order of the day.\nAt last the great moment arrives. The trunk is brought\nbefore him and opened. Oh no! The cash is covered with\na black dye which completely defaces it, rendering it\nuseless! His heart sinks even lower. But don't worry,\nif a certain chemical is applied to the money, it will\nbe washed clean, and once again be good for spending.\nHe watches as the chemical is applied to the money,\nand sure enough, it becomes a fresh new one hundred\ndollar bill!\nBut wait! There is not enough of the chemical to clean\nthe rest of the money! They must purchase more. \"No\nproblem\", he thinks. But wait again! The chemical will\ncost tens of thousands of dollars!! At this point he\nbegins to see his hosts with new eyes. Maybe they are\ncriminals? Imagine, dear friend, the sinking feeling\nthis man is experiencing, much worse than the sinking\nfeeling you are now experiencing! All you lost was\ntime and convenience, and maybe a few dollars for\nflowers. He has lost many thousands of dollars.\nYou see, dear Hillie, I have been onto you from DAY\nONE! Yes, YOU HAVE BEEN SCAMMED!! All the time you\nwere writing to me as \"Josephine\" (Hillie, that is\njust \nSICK!!), not to mention \"Dr. Uzondu\", you were\nlaughing\n at my stupidity, right? You thought you had snared \na real idiot. But all that time, I was the one\nlaughing \nat YOU! Hahaha!  :)\nDo you know how many letters from 419 guys I get in my\nemail? I think I received at least 20 in the last 3\nmonths, mostly, of course, from Nigeria. They come\nfrom \"officials\" in the Petroleum Corporation, with\ntheir over-invoiced contracts; \"officials\" at banks\nwishing to\nget their hands on accounts left there by foreigners\nwho died in plane crashes; \"wives\" of deceased \nmilitary leaders; \"sons\" of deposed or murdered high\nofficials (that's you, Hillie!).\nGot that sinking feeling? Well, even though, as I say,\nI was onto you from the start, you did do some really\nstupid things. Take note:\n1) No official document from a security company would\ncontain so much bad English. Go to school and learn\nEnglish grammar, won't you?\n[]\n2) The signatures on those documents looked\nridiculous, like Chinese, and were obviously written\nby the same person.\n3) What security company would charge TWO HUNDRED\nDOLLARS A DAY for storage??? Maybe your usual\nprocedure is to show this to your intended victim only\nafter he has forked over lots of cash already.\n4) The email address of the security company,\n\"se_2000@yahoo\" or whatever, was created the same day\nthe letter was sent! REALLY STUPID!\n5) What security company would move people out of a\nrefugee camp to a residential area? You told me this\nbecause you never were in a camp, and this would\nexplain why I would never see a camp when I arrived\nthere. See who the idiot really is, dear Hillie?\nI tried my best to help you. I repeatedly wrote\nridiculous things in my letters, to give you a chance\nto see that I was only playing with you. But you know\nwhat? Here is the interesting thing: \nThe same greed that you inspire in your victims, which\ndestroys their sense of logic and judgement, I CREATED\nIN YOU! You were willing to believe anything I wrote,\nso deluded were you in your greed, in your desperation\nto have my money. By the way, I have no company, no\nboat, no large beautiful home, no string of\npolopponies...\nI wrote about crocodiles and bloody teeth in a dream,\ncircumcising you myself, that I could not eat yellow\nfood, and on and on. And the most ridiculous of all...\nwhat kind of ignoramus would declare his undying love\nto a complete stranger he has never met, after only\none\nmeaningless email???\nHillie, ALL THAT IS JUST UNBELIEVABLE! But you\nbelieved it all, every word, because you are so greedy\nyou could not think straight!\nWell, that's it for now. I will be expecting to\nreceive your \"how could you do this to me?\" letter\nfrom \"Josephine\" real soon, as I know how grimly\ntenacious you guys are.\nIf you decide not to write back at this moment, do let\nme know how you are doing from time to time, ok? I\nfeel we are now friends for life, and I look forward\nto visiting you in your country one day. Perhaps we\ncould visit the grave of your parents (save those \nflowers!).\nAh, I see from my email that you have already sent the\n\"how could you do this to me?\" letter.
