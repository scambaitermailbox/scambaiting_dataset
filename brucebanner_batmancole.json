My dear first of all\n let me be picking the points one after another.<br>\n 1 You made mention of the bill of U$15thousand, i am\n not telling you to send the whole U$15 to me, i am\n only trying to inform you the reason why I need your\n help on that issue.<br>\n 2, You made mention of not know if these is real or\n not? there is no how i can tell you that this is\n real, than you receving the change of account/name\n from the high court and you receving the funds in\n your account, the reason why all this, is that if I\n should submit your name and account direct to the\n bank, they will ask you to come down to Nigeria and\n claim your relatives funds, by providing this\n document from court. Or do you want to come to\n Nigeria so that you can see things with your eyes?<br>\n 3, You made mention of not telling the amount needed\n from you to send, right now i have in my hands\n U$5,000.00 dollars and still looking for more money,\n it is left for you to tell me how much you can come\n up with, to enable me know the amount i will be\n looking for.<br><br>\n  \n Finaly the issue of your sending me your contact\n details, is what I dont understand, because i have\n tried serval times to reach you on the telephone but\n it is not going through, moreover you refused to\n send to me your house address up till now which i\n belive that you have something in mind as soon as\n the money is transferred. Right now i am not yet ok\n with all your information, if you still want us to\n do this, let me have your full information as i have\n stated it to you, before telling me anything about\n the money, because that is very very important to\n me.<br><br>\n  \n Thanks<br>\n Batman<br><br>\n\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "2005-05-02 00:00", "subject": "", "author_role": "bait", "body": "Batman,\n\nWhere's the proof?\n\nBruce Banner", "raw": "<hr><font face=\"Arial,Verdana\"><b><font color=\"green\">BRUCE BANNER</font></b><br><br>\n\n\nDate: \t02 May 2005<br><br>\n\nBatman,<br><br>\n\nWhere's the proof?<br><br>\n\nBruce Banner<br><br>\n\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "2005-05-02 00:00", "subject": "", "author_role": "bait", "body": "Batman,\n\nHere is my address, it is my home address as well. \n\nBruce Banner \nDirector Comercial\nBanner Laboratories\nAv.
