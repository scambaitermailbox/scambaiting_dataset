Mr. LeBaux suffered a serious attack Saturday night last, and is presently resting in Hospital, under sedation. Here is what I can tell you, from all the witness reports I can gather:\n\nMr. Jacques and his friend, Mrs. Sarah Bellum, left for the Metropolitan Opera shortly before 8PM, driven by Hugh Jardon. During the intermission of the opera, Mr. Jacques and Mrs. Bellum were visiting and enjoying a glass of champagne, whereupon Mrs. Bellum made some mention of her son, Mortie, who has recently been contacted by a widow-woman in Cote D'Ivoire. Her situation seemed to Mr. Jacques to be remarkably similar to yours, so he pressed for details.\n\nSeveral other patrons of the opera overheard the conversation, and they volunteered that THEY, too, had had some similar experience, but had investigated the person who contacted them, and discovered that the individual was a con-artist, suspected of the famous \"419\" scams of Africa. Mr. Jacques asked, \"How can my Elisabeth cheat ME? She is telling people that I am her husband!\" The people told them that the scam-artists often cheat rich Americans out of many thousands of dollars.\n\nMr. Jacques shouted, \"Well, they won't get any of MY money!!\"\n\nThen he clutched his chest, and collapsed. The Ambulance was called, and he was rushed to the emergency room.\n\nMrs. Sarah accompanied Mr. Jacques to the Hospital, and stayed all night. Mr. Jacques was so grateful to her for staying with him all through the ordeal and keeping vigil at the hospital till he was pronounced out of danger, that he gave her the MOST BEAUTIFUL watch I have ever seen in my life! You should see it, hundreds of diamonds all over it! It is simply exquisite. He is such a wonderful, generous gentleman, I am privileged to be in his employ, he presented me with a superb new lap-top computer as congratulations for my promotion.\n\nI hope all this hasn't inconvenienced you too much, Mrs. Lamine, Mr. Jacques will not be transacting business for some time, though it is hoped that he will be released from the Hospital by next Saturday next.\n\nSincerely, Tara Raboum, T.A.", "raw": "<hr>\n<span class=\"jc\">Tara  writes with distressing news...</span><br><br>\n<span class=\"tr\">Tara Raboom, T.A.</span><br><br><span class=\"ast\">\n\n\n\nMrs. Lamine:<br><br>\n\nI am Tara Raboum, Vice President of LeBaux Industries, INC, and Technical Assistant to Mr. Jacques N.
