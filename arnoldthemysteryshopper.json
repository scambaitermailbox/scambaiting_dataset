So were in line for the Western Union thing, but I was chewin on some of Jakes tobacco and you know how it is, it really loosens your guts up. There was a long line so I left Jake holdin my place while I went to drop the kids off at the pool, but when I gets back this skinny dude starts gettin all in my face about cuttin in line. I told him hed better watch his mouth or Id open up a can of whoopass on him, but he wasnt gonna listen. The dude was crazy, probly some meth head or somethin. Anyway I popped him real good in the mouth and he went down, but next thing I now the security shows up with the cops and I get arested. So if you want your report on the Walmart, Id say it sucks, becuse its bullshit that they arest me just for defendin myself against some crazy guy whos all up in my face and everythin.
