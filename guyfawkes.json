Just recently she hired a private detective to trace my whereabouts and I have discovered she has had my phone bugged to try and find out where I keep my money hidden - I think she wants to steal it from me but I wont let her - it is in a very safe place where she will not think of looking.\n\nI have received a contact from Doctor Bello, the bank Director Doctor Who has given me the name of the lawyer to contact - his email address is tigani22johnson@yahoo.co.uk. and I will be contacting him shortly.\n\nI have received all the pictures you sent of the documents together with your passport photo which seemed OK this time - What a nice picture it is of you as well - I bet you have lots of girls chasing you!!\n\nI have spoken to Mr. Roger and he seems OK - Now we have the documents he seemed a bit happier.\n\nI am a little bit confused at the moment - perhaps you could clarify something for me. The good Doctor has told me that we need the affidavit to show the money is drug trafficking and laundry free yet the remittance document contains a statement that the account holder has already declared that the funds deposited are lawfully and properly acquired, are for the purposes of buying machinery etc and that you, my brother Morgan are the account holder and are already empowered to nominate me as your foreign business partner and that as soon as you nominate me to the bank (which we have done already) the bank will transfer the funds. This document has already been signed by Lawyer Tigani so I do not understand why we need to involve him anymore - cant we just get on with the transfer?\n\nI have to provide details of my bank - which I need to set up because my ex-wife is chasing me for money and I don't want her to find out about this stash so please bear with me while I do this and I will send you the details when it is sorted.\n\nIf you need it my fax number is 1(501)637-8107 () if you need to send me something. I will contact Doctor Bello as soon as I can (probably tomorrow).\n\nYou will be pleased to know that Mr Roger has made great headway with his secret case - he has discovered that Guido is plotting to explode something - he doesn't know what yet but it is pretty big - in fact he thinks it is a very clever plot that may result in a model that could be used to overthrow many governments in the world - if you are still having trouble with your terrorists perhaps Mr. Roger can help - I will ask him! - I only advise him on freedom strategy and rights of the people. Mr. Roger is currently planning to use his share of the money to finance his own band of mercenaries called the New Model Army and I am writing their manifesto - exciting times brother don't you think.

Just recently she hired a private detective to trace my whereabouts and I have discovered she has had my phone bugged to try and find out where I keep my money hidden - I think she wants to steal it from me but I wont let her - it is in a very safe place where she will not think of looking.<br><br>\n\nI have received a contact from Doctor Bello, the bank Director Doctor Who has given me the name of the lawyer to contact - his email address is tigani22johnson@yahoo.co.uk. and I will be contacting him shortly.<br><br>\n\nI have received all the pictures you sent of the documents together with your passport photo which seemed OK this time - What a nice picture it is of you as well - I bet you have lots of girls chasing you!!<br><br>\n\nI have spoken to Mr. Roger and he seems OK - Now we have the documents he seemed a bit happier.<br><br>\n\nI am a little bit confused at the moment - perhaps you could clarify something for me. The good Doctor has told me that we need the affidavit to show the money is drug trafficking and laundry free yet the remittance document contains a statement that the account holder has already declared that the funds deposited are lawfully and properly acquired, are for the purposes of buying machinery etc and that you, my brother Morgan are the account holder and are already empowered to nominate me as your foreign business partner and that as soon as you nominate me to the bank (which we have done already) the bank will transfer the funds. This document has already been signed by Lawyer Tigani so I do not understand why we need to involve him anymore - cant we just get on with the transfer?<br><br>\n\nI have to provide details of my bank - which I need to set up because my ex-wife is chasing me for money and I don't want her to find out about this stash so please bear with me while I do this and I will send you the details when it is sorted.<br><br>\n\nIf you need it my fax number is 1(501)637-8107 (<font  color=\"blue\">this is an efax number set up on a 30 day free trial</font>) if you need to send me something.

I am a bit reluctant to send this money to your lawyer as I am not sure he is trustworthy in this matter however I will take your judgement into account. I am concerned about why the payment needs to be made in cash as most courts do not deal with cash, it is certainly more usual to have bank transfers for any money due so I would like to make one more effort, if we need to pay money to the court can you give me the address of the court that will be dealing with this as I will be able to pay them direct - which is much safer as we are not dealing with cash and it would be quicker and you keep telling me that speed is important, all your lawyer will need to do is submit the affidavit to the court and when they have confirmed the transfer has been received we may proceed.\n\nI agree to the lawyer deducting his fees of $15,000 dollars from the total deposited in the bank - this again is usual in my country and as he does not need his fee until the transfer is completed it should not present any problems. I presume we will be sharing this cost equally and it does not come wholly out of my share, particularly as I will be financing the initial $2620.\n\nI am very concerned that your condition is bad and that your uncle is treating you for your illness, are you sure he is not trying to poison you - how did he find you? I thought you were in hiding from him and he did not know where you are?

I am a bit reluctant to send this money to your lawyer as I am not sure he is trustworthy in this matter however I will take your judgement into account. I am concerned about why the payment needs to be made in cash as most courts do not deal with cash, it is certainly more usual to have bank transfers for any money due so I would like to make one more effort, if we need to pay money to the court can you give me the address of the court that will be dealing with this as I will be able to pay them direct - which is much safer as we are not dealing with cash and it would be quicker and you keep telling me that speed is important, all your lawyer will need to do is submit the affidavit to the court and when they have confirmed the transfer has been received we may proceed.<br><br>\n\nI agree to the lawyer deducting his fees of $15,000 dollars from the total deposited in the bank - this again is usual in my country and as he does not need his fee until the transfer is completed it should not present any problems. I presume we will be sharing this cost equally and it does not come wholly out of my share, particularly as I will be financing the initial $2620.<br><br>\n\nI am very concerned that your condition is bad and that your uncle is treating you for your illness, are you sure he is not trying to poison you - how did he find you?
