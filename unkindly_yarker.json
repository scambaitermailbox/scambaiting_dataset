Lee,\n\nThere isn't a transfer slip to scan so I don't know\nwhat you're suggesting.  If you would look at \nthe bank statement you would see the issue that the\nbank has noted regarding the check.  So there can't\nbe a transfer slip until the issue is resolved.\n\nLuckily I received an email from a banker today, a Mr\nTimothy Zumba, and he has agreed to assist\nme with this problems.\n\nI wish you a happy holiday.  I am going to my\nrelatives for Thanksgiving and will return to my\nemails on Monday.\n\nRegards", "raw": "<hr>\n<br>\n\n\n<span class=\"u\">THE UNKINDLY CONTRIBUTOR</span><br><br><span class=\"ast\">\n\nMr Lee,<br><br>\n\nThere isn't a transfer slip to scan so I don't know\nwhat you're suggesting.
