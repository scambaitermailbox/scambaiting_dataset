After this, the money will be banked online for both of us. We can then instruct the bank to transfer our various shares into our respective home bank accounts.\n\nI will also perfect/finance the documentations with the assistance of my attorney to give the transaction the legal right. Before I commence, I will need you to send me a copy of any form your identification (Driver's license Work ID or International passport) and your Name & Current address. I want to be sure that I am transacting with the correct person. As soon as I get these from you, I will commence the paper work. I hope you will understand why I need all these, the money in question is big and I want to ensure that I know you well before I proceed to give you all the details to commence the project, I will send the name and contact details of the bank so that you can commence communication with them.\n\nI have really invested much in this transaction so I will please tell you to accept the 40% while i take 60% of the total funds that I have intend to give to you. For your information I will be coming over to your country for my share of the funds, once the funds is credited in your account at the bank that we will be using for this transaction.\n\nPlease endeavor to keep this transaction confidential, Please do not discuss it with anybody, I have a 22year career with my bank (Bank Of England) and I do not intend to ruin all that.

They had bought a case of wine, (and he still commanded me to bring MORE) and even before they started cooking dinner, they had drunk 2 bottles of it, so they were pretty well \"lit up\" by the time to put the turkey in the oven.

We all barely got out of the house alive!\n\nLong story short, the turkey exploded, and the fat from it caught fire, and burned all the food, the kitchen was destroyed, and that part of Stan's house (really, a mansion) burnt to the ground. The fire probably caused about $75,000 damage, according to the Fire Chief. All in all, 3 big firetrucks were called to put out the fire, which took 3 hours to do!\n\nThen, Phyllis thought it would be fun to perform a strip-tease dance for the fire-fighters, so in a few minutes she was naked as the day she was born, cavorting all over the front lawn. I told you she was drunk, didn't I? It was quite a sight to see, especially in the 25\u00b0, snowy early afternoon.\n\nNeedless to say, the local cops, Russ and Dan, arrested all of us, but they kept Stan on a charge of drunk and disorderly, and they let Kat and me go, because we hadn't done anything wrong, and we'd only had 1 glass of wine before all the excitement.
