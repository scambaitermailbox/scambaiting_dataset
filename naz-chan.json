In the course of my responsibility, I discovered $47.1M USD (Forty-Seven Million, One Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) left unclaimed by a deceased customer since September, 2005. Every exploration I made showed that there is no registered beneficiary to these funds, this is why I contacted you because it would have been my pleasure to have this money to myself or ask any of my family member to conclude this with me but due to the fact that it will not work out that way I have to search for someone more competent from outside Hong Kong to execute this transaction with me without putting my job in a peril state.\n\n\nI want to be sure you are ready and proficient to see this transaction with me to achievement. What we both need to achieve this transaction is trust and commitment; I believe with your assistance, we will be able to transfer this large sum conveniently without exercising any fear. And also regarding the legality, I want to put it to you that in achieving this transaction, you should know that what affects you implies to me too.
