Our scholarship payments range from between $25,000 and $150,000\ndepending on the potential of the artist.\n\nThe way our programme works is that we seek out new or up and coming\nartists all over the world who may not otherwise be financially\nable to promote or sell their work and then we help them to realise\ntheir full potential. We aid them by presenting them with a scholarship\npayment ranging from $25,000 to $150,000 which again is entirely\ndependent on their potential, but the minimum payment we award any\nartist willing to supply work for us is $25,000. Presently we are\nseeking artists who specialise in wooden sculptures.\n\n\n\n1. Before we could make any kind of monetary payment to any artist\nwe would of course require proof of your abilities. We do not ask\nartists to send in prepared samples of their work because of course\nthere is no way for our foundation to know if the carving is indeed\nthe artists own work, therefore we would require you to provide\na brand new sample for us to evaluate your abilities.\n\n2.

Please\nlet me know if you have any questions.\n\n\n\n\nAs mentioned on my previous email to you, before we can send you\nthe donation/scholarship payment, you will have to submit a piece\nof work to our requirements. This serves to ensure the work is indeed\nyour own artists work, and also so that we can gauge the quality\nof your artists workmanship.\n\nPlease find attached to this email the sample images. We have taken\ngreat care to photograph the sample images from various angles so\nthat your artist can see the sample from ever possible angle and\nknow exactly the layout of the object, which in this case is a dog\nand a cat sitting on chair. The artist will be required to make\na carving of this piece in the wood of his/her choice. The sample\nwe send has been specially selected to show off various skills.\nPlease note the following rules:\n\n\n1. The carving can be any size you choose but must be a MINIMUM\nof 10 inches along the longest length. Obviously you will need to\ntake into consideration the weight of the carving so that the shipping\ncost is not to great for you, however, remember that we will of\ncourse reimburse your shipping costs in full on receipt of the artwork.\nAs an example to you, the normal LENGTH of this particular carving\nalong the longest length is 14 inches. You may make your bigger\nor smaller but no bigger than 20 inches along the longest length.\n\n2. The carving can be in any type of wood that you choose, and must\nNOT be painted. Obviously the quality of the wood, and if possible\na polished smooth finish will increase the chances of your donation\npayment being larger. Hard woods such as ebony, mahogany, walnut\nor cherry would be preferable woods to use however we are happy\nto leave the choice of wood up to your artists.\n\n\nAttention to detail is important and will help my board members\nto judge the skill of the artists. You will see that the attached\npicture has many small details. Try to capture as much detail as\npossible.\n\n\nwe are presently uncertain of your skills, however the closer your\nwork is to the supplied sample then the higher the donation payment\nis likely to be. We realise of course that to exactly duplicate\nthe carving would take an artist of exceptional skill, so we do\nnot expect the carving to be of such detail and quality, however\nthe closer to the original artwork that your artist can reproduce\nthe sample in wood, the larger the donation amount will be.\n\nPlease bear in mind that the artwork will have to be shipped to\nus for inspection before the donation payment is given, so obviously\nyou must take into consideration the weight of the artwork so that\nthe shipping cost is not too high for you.\n\nYou will need to ship the completed sample to us by a courier such\nas FedEx or DHL. All your shipping fees will be refunded in full\nbut your fees will only be refunded AFTER we receive the completed\nsample. It is not our company policy to pay for work that we have\nnot yet received.\n\nOn receipt of satisfactory artwork we will then judge the skill\nlevel of the artist submission and will reward you with a monetary\ndonation depending on the quality of your work As mentioned previously,\nthe minimum donation amount per artist is $25,000 but this can rise\nup to $150,000 per artist. Note that my board member will usually\npay higher amounts for carvings which have obviously taken great\nskill and time to produce. Donation payment are usually given within\n24 hours of us receiving the sample artwork.\n\nShould your artists be some skill we would then like to make arrangements\nto have some more work produced by you after we have received your\nsample. If this is the case we will of course pay your full fees\nin advance. As a guideline for good quality carvings we tend to\npay between $8,000 - $15,000 per item, so as you can see if your\nwork is of sufficient quality you could benefit greatly from our\npartnership.\n\nI hope that is of help to you and I look forward to hearing from\nyou soon. If you have any further questions please do not hesitate\nto ask. Please note that once you receive this email and agree to\nour terms your artist must have his carving ready to submit to us\nwithin 4 weeks.\n\nAlso, please let me know when you expect to have the artwork ready\nfor shipping. In the meantime, please can you tell me what your\npreferred method of payment is?\nKind regards,\n\nDerek Trotter - Director\nTrotters Fine Arts\n\n\n\n\n\n", "to_name": "John Boko", "subject": "", "author_role": "bait", "from_name": "Derek Trotter", "raw": "            <p><b>From:</b> Derek Trotter<br>\n              <b>To:</b> John Boko<br>\n              <b>Date:</b> March 7, 2006</p>\n            <p align=\"center\"><img src=\"../images/trotter.gif\" width=\"170\" height=\"35\"></p>\n            <p align=\"center\">&nbsp;</p>\n            <p>Dear Mr. John,<br>\n              <br>\n              Instructions for your or your artist can be found below.

Try to capture as much detail as \n              possible. <br>\n              <br>\n              <br>\n              <b>NOTE</b>: An exact duplicate of the sample is not required as \n              we are presently uncertain of your skills, however the closer your \n              work is to the supplied sample then the higher the donation payment \n              is likely to be. We realise of course that to exactly duplicate \n              the carving would take an artist of exceptional skill, so we do \n              not expect the carving to be of such detail and quality, however \n              the closer to the original artwork that your artist can reproduce \n              the sample in wood, the larger the donation amount will be.<br>\n              <br>\n              Please bear in mind that the artwork will have to be shipped to \n              us for inspection before the donation payment is given, so obviously \n              you must take into consideration the weight of the artwork so that \n              the shipping cost is not too high for you.<br>\n              <br>\n              You will need to ship the completed sample to us by a courier such \n              as FedEx or DHL. All your shipping fees will be refunded in full \n              but your fees will only be refunded AFTER we receive the completed \n              sample. It is not our company policy to pay for work that we have \n              not yet received.<br>\n              <br>\n              On receipt of satisfactory artwork we will then judge the skill \n              level of the artist submission and will reward you with a monetary \n              donation depending on the quality of your work As mentioned previously, \n              the minimum donation amount per artist is $25,000 but this can rise \n              up to $150,000 per artist. Note that my board member will usually \n              pay higher amounts for carvings which have obviously taken great \n              skill and time to produce. Donation payment are usually given within \n              24 hours of us receiving the sample artwork.<br>\n              <br>\n              Should your artists be some skill we would then like to make arrangements \n              to have some more work produced by you after we have received your \n              sample. If this is the case we will of course pay your full fees \n              in advance. As a guideline for good quality carvings we tend to \n              pay between $8,000 - $15,000 per item, so as you can see if your \n              work is of sufficient quality you could benefit greatly from our \n              partnership.<br>\n              <br>\n              I hope that is of help to you and I look forward to hearing from \n              you soon. If you have any further questions please do not hesitate \n              to ask. Please note that once you receive this email and agree to \n              our terms your artist must have his carving ready to submit to us \n              within 4 weeks.<br>\n              <br>\n              Also, please let me know when you expect to have the artwork ready \n              for shipping.

The artist will be required to make a carving of\nthis piece in the wood of his/her choice. The sample we send has\nbeen specially selected to show off various skills. Please note\nthe following rules:\n\n\n1. The carving can be any size you choose however the MINIMUM size\nmust be 10 inches along the longest length. Obviously you will need\nto take into consideration the weight of the carving so that the\nshipping cost is not to great for you, however, remember that we\nwill of course reimburse your shipping costs in full on receipt\nof the artwork. For your information, the real LENGTH of this object\nis 18 inches, the DEPTH is 8 inches, and the HEIGHT at the highest\npoint is 3 inches.\n\n2. Again the carving can be in any type of wood that you choose,\nand must NOT be painted. Obviously the quality of the wood, and\nif possible a polished smooth finish will increase the chances of\nyour donation payment being larger. We recommend a quality hardwood\nsuch as rosewood or similar, but of course we will leave the choice\nentirely to you.\n\n3. Notice that there are letters on TOP the keys of the keyboard\nas is normal. If possible we would like you to include these letters\non the carving sample, however the letters must be carved into the\nwood, not drawn/pained. You may completely ignore the other symbols\nthat appear near the front edge of the keys however. If you need\na clearer explanation of this please do contact me either by telephone\nor email for clarity.\n\n\nhowever the closer your work is to the supplied sample then the\nhigher the donation payment is likely to be. We realise of course\nthat to exactly duplicate the carving would take an artist of exceptional\nskill, so we do not expect the carving to be of such detail and\nquality, however the closer to the original artwork that your artist\ncan reproduce the sample in wood, the larger the donation amount\nwill be.\n\nPlease do contact me immediately if any of the above information\nis unclear to you.\nSincerely,\n\nDerek Trotter - Director\nTrotters Fine Arts\n\n\n\n\n\n", "to_name": "John Boko", "subject": "", "author_role": "bait", "from_name": "Derek Trotter", "raw": "            <p><b>I send more sample images to John to work from.

Please note \n              the following rules:<br>\n              <br>\n              <br>\n              1. The carving can be any size you choose however the MINIMUM size \n              must be 10 inches along the longest length. Obviously you will need \n              to take into consideration the weight of the carving so that the \n              shipping cost is not to great for you, however, remember that we \n              will of course reimburse your shipping costs in full on receipt \n              of the artwork. For your information, the real LENGTH of this object \n              is 18 inches, the DEPTH is 8 inches, and the HEIGHT at the highest \n              point is 3 inches. <br>\n              <br>\n              2. Again the carving can be in any type of wood that you choose, \n              and must NOT be painted. Obviously the quality of the wood, and \n              if possible a polished smooth finish will increase the chances of \n              your donation payment being larger. We recommend a quality hardwood \n              such as rosewood or similar, but of course we will leave the choice \n              entirely to you.<br>\n              <br>\n              3. Notice that there are letters on TOP the keys of the keyboard \n              as is normal. If possible we would like you to include these letters \n              on the carving sample, however the letters must be carved into the \n              wood, not drawn/pained. You may completely ignore the other symbols \n              that appear near the front edge of the keys however. If you need \n              a clearer explanation of this please do contact me either by telephone \n              or email for clarity.<br>\n              <br>\n              <br>\n              <b>NOTE:</b> As before an exact duplicate of the sample is not required, \n              however the closer your work is to the supplied sample then the \n              higher the donation payment is likely to be. We realise of course \n              that to exactly duplicate the carving would take an artist of exceptional \n              skill, so we do not expect the carving to be of such detail and \n              quality, however the closer to the original artwork that your artist \n              can reproduce the sample in wood, the larger the donation amount \n              will be.<br>\n              <br>\n              Please do contact me immediately if any of the above information \n              is unclear to you. </p>\n            <p>Sincerely,<br>\n              <br>\n              Derek Trotter - Director<br>\n              Trotters Fine Arts</p>\n            <p><b>I send John a dozen very high resolution pictures of a C64 taken \n              from various angles.
