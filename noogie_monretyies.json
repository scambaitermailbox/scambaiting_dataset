As I tried to explain to you, when I spoke with Ms. Bushburn the phone connection was bad and she speaks with a heavy Ukrainian accent. She sometimes mixes Russian and English and she can be very difficult to understand. I spoke with her again last night and I think I know what the problem was.\n\n\nIt appears that she transposed a couple of the MTCN numbers. Instead of 0917001119 it should be 0971001119, and she also had neglected to tell me that she used a different Test Question and Answer. She felt that using my name was not secure enough. Below is the information she gave me over the phone last night:\n\n\nReceiver's Name..Ms. Obunso Andrew\nTest Question..Favorite nail Polish?\nTest Answer:...Rosy Future\nM T C N..0971001119\nAmount.............$985USD\nReceiver Country  Benin Republic\nSender's Name:  Maya Bushburn\n\n\nI'm pretty sure that this information will work.

As I tried to explain to you, when I spoke with Ms. Bushburn the phone connection was bad and she speaks with a heavy Ukrainian accent. She sometimes mixes Russian and English and she can be very difficult to understand. I spoke with her again last night and I think I know what the problem was.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt appears that she transposed a couple of the MTCN numbers. Instead of 0917001119 it should be 0971001119, and she also had neglected to tell me that she used a different Test Question and Answer. She felt that using my name was not secure enough.
