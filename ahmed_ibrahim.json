On seeing\nthis, it will prove to me 100% that I am dealing with a totally\nhonest person as this image will not be able to be forged. If yourself,\nMr. Ibrahim, or representative is agreeable to this then I will\nforward a suitable image as an attachment for you to print out.\nI hope you will agree that this is a small thing to ask in return\nfor my help in this matter.\nMay I presume that processing fees may be required to facilitate\nthe release of these funds? In the UK I have to deal with such fees\non a regular basis. This is not a problem, and on receipt of proof\nof your identity (the photo) I will be happy to release any necessary\nfunds of my own should they be needed. If it is at all possible,\nit would be of great benefit if you would be able to calculate the\ntotal amount that may be required to facilitate the urgent completion\nof your proposition.\nMy sincere regards,\nKlench Mychiques\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nFrom the desk of Klench Mychiques - Stuntman Extraordinaire\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n", "from_name": "Klench Mychiques"}, {"raw": "            <p align=\"left\"><i>Date: Sat, 30 Aug 2003 08:33:19 +0100 (BST)<br>\n              From: &quot;gbamuda nngida&quot; <br>\n              Subject: Re: ACCEPTED CONDITION..</i></p>\n            <p align=\"left\"><i>Dear Mr Klench,</i></p>\n            <p align=\"left\"><i>Many thanks for your mail.</i></p>\n            <p align=\"left\"><i>Your condition is quite acceptable,because this \n              days alot of things happens around the world,and that makes someone \n              doubt who is GOOD or BAD,i will not be surprise to hear that the \n              sum of $23,773 was taken away from you,so Please do forward the \n              attachment to me.</i></p>\n            <p align=\"left\"><i>I like to use this medium to expantiate that the \n              identity of DR.IBRAHIM AHMED meant was not his photograph picture \n              as you thought, but DR AHMED'S INTERNATIONAL PASSPORT,i hope the \n              international passport will serve to your request.Incase it is not \n              enough please get me informed ASAP while i expect your attached \n              picture and details/specimen of how you want the holding of sign \n              with your names.</i></p>\n            <p align=\"left\"><i>Finally,the fees mentioned in your mail is not \n              known to me yet,except as we progress.</i></p>\n            <p align=\"left\"><i>Barrister N.Gbamuda.<br>\n              CODE:&quot;PEACE&quot;</i></p>\n            <p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p>\n", "author_role": "scam", "comments": [], "subject": "Re: ACCEPTED CONDITION..", "date": "Sat, 30 Aug 2003 08:33:19 +0100 (BST)", "to_name": "", "body": "Dear Mr Klench,\nMany thanks for your mail.\nYour condition is quite acceptable,because this\ndays alot of things happens around the world,and that makes someone\ndoubt who is GOOD or BAD,i will not be surprise to hear that the\nsum of $23,773 was taken away from you,so Please do forward the\nattachment to me.\nI like to use this medium to expantiate that the\nidentity of DR.IBRAHIM AHMED meant was not his photograph picture\nas you thought, but DR AHMED'S INTERNATIONAL PASSPORT,i hope the\ninternational passport will serve to your request.Incase it is not\nenough please get me informed ASAP while i expect your attached\npicture and details/specimen of how you want the holding of sign\nwith your names.\nFinally,the fees mentioned in your mail is not\nknown to me yet,except as we progress.\nBarrister N.Gbamuda.\nCODE:\"PEACE\"\n\n\n", "from_name": "\"gbamuda nngida\""}, {"raw": "            <p><b>From: Klench Mychiques<br>\n              To: Mr. Gbamuda</b></p>\n            <p>Dear Barrister N.
