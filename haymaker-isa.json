My dear Bishop, please can you\nmake any viable contact to Chicago Police office??? do\nyou know anybody who lives in Chicago?? because our\ndear Isa said his plane will only depart from the\nChicago Airport at 4:20 PM on Saturday and arrives in\nAmsterdam at 10:40 AM on the Sunday, so if you can\ncontact the Police in Chicago with his full\nidentification to stop him from boarding the airplane\non Saturday as he said, i think that will be 100% ok\nfor me. Let them return our dear Isa back to Hamlet\nimmediately, there is nobody called Georgina in our\nlineage because i am a true relative to Isa, so Mr\nFrank William is a criminal who is trying to reap off\nour dear brother Isa his money with a false pretence\nthat we have a kinswoman in Netherland  gravely\ninjured. THIS IS FALSE!!!!!!  The story by Mr Frank\nWilliams is all fake and dubious because our Amish\npeople does not have any lineage in Netherland, my\ngrandfather Mr Chris Kringle who is late now and was\nrelated to my Ewe family here in Lome Togo died with\nhis wife since long ago in 1999 and have nothing to do\nin Amsterdam Holland Hospital.\n<br><br>\nMr Frank William and Dr. Frankenstein's are all jokers\nand SCAM FRAUDSTER con artist men who are trying to\nreap off our dear Isa all his life earned money.\nPlease try your best possible and contact the United\nStates Embassy at the Hauge immediately so that they\ncan take immediate action to arrest this fraudsters at\nthe Schipol airport Amsterdam upon there arrival on\nSunday to wait for my Brother Isa Haymaker, i dont\nwant my brother Isa to die in Netherland, please i\nneed your immediate help and action because the\nfraudsters are very dangerous and may end up killing\nhim there.

The circumstance at\npresent now is to excommunicate this person (MR FRANK\nWILLIAMS) from our dear Isa because i dont want my\nbrother Isa Haymaker to get himself killed in\nAmsterdam Holland or would you come to blame me\ntomorrow if he losses his life??????? if possible\nplease lets flash his indentity name and picture at\nthe Schipol Airport Amsterdam Holland so that the\nNetherland Police can deport him back alive upon his\narrival on the Sunday morning according to his flight\nschedule because his life is now in danger.\n<br><br>\nDear Bishop, please contact the U.S. secret Police\nAgency or the Chicago Police so that they can verify\nthe flight bookings made by Isa for this trip on\nSaturday to Netherland and put everything to a hitch\nuntil when Isa will be ready to meet me upon his\narrival in lome Togo by the 12th of this Month January\nok!!!!!!!

What a time I've been having! I went to\nChicago, a ride I never want to repeat in my life. \nCold, and the trucks just kept honking and honking at\nme.  I rode cross-country most of the time, but you\njust can't avoid riding on the Interstate in that part\nof the country.  When I got close enough to find a\nhotel with airport van service, they gave me a hassle\nabout putting the horse in a guestroom.  I was pretty\nshort with them, let me tell you, and they backed\ndown.  When I got to the airport, there was this weird\nTHING hovering just above me, (see photograph), and\nthen suddenly, there was a humongous flash! When I\ncould see again, I was inside a strange room with\nstrange looking people.  They must come from the other\nside of the world, because I have NEVER seen anybody\nlike them before in my life.  Look at the eye folds in\nthis photograph.  I think they MUST be Chinese,\nbecause I always heard that Chinese people looked very\nstrange.  They hooked up a lot of wires to me, and\nasked me a lot of questions, and then, well, I just\ncan't bear to write about what they did to me next,\nbut it involved high-pressure hoses, a lot of water,\nand every single opening in my body.\n\nTHEY SAID THEY KNEW GEORGINA!  They also said not to\ngo to Amsterdam, because Georgina and the twins were\nfine, and they had just dropped Georgina, Tarzan, and\nthe twins back home in Africa.  I asked them about\nFrank Williams, and they said that they didn't know\nhim, but that they meant to pick him up and check him\nout.  They seemed particularly interested in him. \nApparently the Chinese have figured out some way of\ntracking down the whereabouts of anybody who has sent\nan email in his life before, and they didn't expect to\nhave any trouble finding him.  I mentioned about\nGeorgina's box and they said that Georgina hadn't had\nany boxes in storage, so I guess you are right that\nGeorge and Georgina are two different people.  How\nstrange that they are both related to me!  When they\nwere done, they dropped me off at the Kitty Kat\nLounge, and I FORGOT TO ASK FOR THE HORSE BACK. After\nthat I had to talk to General Hazzard of the U.S. Air\nForce about the Chinese gentlemen, and he had his\npeople hook me up to wires just like the Chinese folk,\nbut thankfully, they didn't use any hoses or water.\n\nYour exhausted brother\n\nIsa\n\nP.S.

He was\nable to see the vessel very clearly, and said that it\nrose smoothly from the ground and could move in all\ndirections like a helicopter, but was completely\nsoundless.

I\nreceived an email from Isa today confirming that the\nchinese aliens told him that Mr Frank William is a con\nman and a fraudster who is trying to cheat on our dear\nold brother Isa.  The bishop of Shire, Bishop Baggins\nhave done a good job too, i will never disabuse Isa of\nhis comforting beleive that he was abducted by the\nChinese government, but already Reuben have giving him\na clear briefing that the abduction was made by the\nchinese alien and dear Isa have beleived this as true.\n\nThe story of Mr Frank Williams is fake and fettish,\nDr. Frankenstein's is a partner to him in crime, so\ndont ever beleive in such telephone conversation which\nhe have with dear Isa because both are working for one\ngoal, just to scam our brother Isa and reap him off\nhis hard earned money.  Now that he have been exposed\nas a fraudster he is using Dr. Frankenstein's as a\nrefuge to commuincate Mr Isa Haymaker. Georgina,\nTarzan, are none existing people, moreover our Amish\npeople does not bear such strange names as you can\nbear me witness!!

Tinkerbell,\n<br><br>\nThanks for your kind email to me! I am very happy for\nall your good work in protecting our dear Isa and i\nhave also received the pictures which Isa sent to me\nyesterday about his abduction by the Chinese Alien. I\nreceived an email from Isa today confirming that the\nchinese aliens told him that Mr Frank William is a con\nman and a fraudster who is trying to cheat on our dear\nold brother Isa.  The bishop of Shire, Bishop Baggins\nhave done a good job too, i will never disabuse Isa of\nhis comforting beleive that he was abducted by the\nChinese government, but already Reuben have giving him\na clear briefing that the abduction was made by the\nchinese alien and dear Isa have beleived this as true.\n<br><br>\nThe story of Mr Frank Williams is fake and fettish,\nDr. Frankenstein's is a partner to him in crime, so\ndont ever beleive in such telephone conversation which\nhe have with dear Isa because both are working for one\ngoal, just to scam our brother Isa and reap him off\nhis hard earned money.  Now that he have been exposed\nas a fraudster he is using Dr. Frankenstein's as a\nrefuge to commuincate Mr Isa Haymaker. Georgina,\nTarzan, are none existing people, moreover our Amish\npeople does not bear such strange names as you can\nbear me witness!!
