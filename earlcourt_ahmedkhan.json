Donations will be used for all three, key phases in Pakistan.\n\n\nUNDF, the natural disaster relief arm of the Organization of United Kingdom, has more than 150 people working Pakistan on economic development, disaster mitigation and protecting human rights. UNDF is a non-profit, 501(c)(3) organization based in London and Pakistan.\n\n\nThe Devastating Flood that shattered Pakistan, the poorest country in the Middle East Hemisphere, has already claimed the lives of tens of thousands, perhaps even hundreds of thousands and have destroyed properties. Approximately 1 million people, about a third of Pakistan population, will be affected directly or indirectly from the Flood and its aftermath. The search for survivors continues unabated, but as time goes by the chances of finding survivors are reduced.\n\n\nThe United Nations Development Foundation is among the countries leading aid efforts in Pakistan. Our workers and doctors have been working tirelessly to rescue and heal thousands of the victim in Pakistan. A day after the Flood, NATAN, a national humanitarian relief operation uniting the efforts of dozens of specialist non-profit organizations specializing in emergency aid, flew to Pakistan to distribute medical care and life saving equipment, and to provide professional aid. This team will soon be joined - with your help - by 20 more aid missions specializing in rehabilitation, care for the homeless, aid for orphans, psycho-social and post-trauma support by mental-health professionals, and basic medical aid. With your support, we can send these specialist teams to Pakistan without delay and fully supplied.\n\n\nEvery team consists of 10 volunteer professional and will stay in Pakistan for 24 days. Expenses are estimated at $2,000 per day - every dollar of support will allow us to bring the best specialist aid to Pakistan and keep our teams there as long as possible.\n\n\nEvery donation will help.
