These two witnesses must declare to\nme, via email, that they witnessed your public\ndeclaration of fellowship with the Church of the Holy\nPineapple. \n\nAlso, there must be a public demonstration of faith. \nThe nature of that public demonstration will require\nthat you pose with a photograph, of you seated on a\nchair, with a pineapple on top of your head.

You must also\nsend us the photograph as we have described.  At that\npoint we will then send you $25,000 so that you can\nhelp spread our ministry. \n\nPlease indicate your willingness to do this by no\nlater than Friday, the 18th of June.

My\nfamily is doing fine, and I hope that your family is\nin good health. \n\nI have recently returned from Mexico, where I was\nattending a conference. \n\nThe Church of the Holy Pineapple was established in\nHawaii in July of 1986.  The pineapple industry is one\nof Hawaii's largest exports and thus we chose that so\nthat we could provide outreach to the native\nislanders. \n\nIn 1990, the Church headquarters were moved to Battle\nMountain, Nevada, in an effort to reduce our operating\ncosts, so that we could provide more money to our\nministries overseas.  We expanded into Mexico in 1993,\ninto the Philippines in 1994, into Europe in 1995, and\nJapan in 1996.  In 1998, we declared Fellowship with\nthe Church of the Exalted Fish, which is based in\nEngland.  At present we are looking to get established\nin Africa. \n\nTo become a member, you must read our Declaration of\nFaith in the presence of either a Church Officer, or\nin the presence of at least two witnesses, who will\ncertify that they heard the public reading of the\nDeclaration of Faith. \n\nThe applicant must also pose for a photograph, in\nthose instances where a Church Officer is not present.\n In this photograph, the applicant sits down in a\nchair, and places a pineapple on top of his head.  \n\nIf the pineapple balances on top of the head without\nfalling off, that is a sign that the Declarant has\nbeen doubly blessed, and is eligible for advancement\ninto the senior ranks of the Ministry.  In most cases,\nholding the pineapple on top of the head with one hand\nis customary since the pineapple does not always\nbalance. \n\nIf the pineapple balances of its own accord, the\nDeclarant is then awarded a DOUBLE portion of funding,\nas that such a person is truly blessed, and will need\nthe extra funding. \n\nAt present we have US$30,680 available for a Ministry\nin Africa.

My\nfamily is doing fine, and I hope that your family is\nin good health. <br><br>\n\nI have recently returned from Mexico, where I was\nattending a conference. <br><br>\n\nThe Church of the Holy Pineapple was established in\nHawaii in July of 1986.  The pineapple industry is one\nof Hawaii's largest exports and thus we chose that so\nthat we could provide outreach to the native\nislanders. <br><br>\n\nIn 1990, the Church headquarters were moved to Battle\nMountain, Nevada, in an effort to reduce our operating\ncosts, so that we could provide more money to our\nministries overseas.  We expanded into Mexico in 1993,\ninto the Philippines in 1994, into Europe in 1995, and\nJapan in 1996.  In 1998, we declared Fellowship with\nthe Church of the Exalted Fish, which is based in\nEngland.  At present we are looking to get established\nin Africa. <br><br>\n\nTo become a member, you must read our Declaration of\nFaith in the presence of either a Church Officer, or\nin the presence of at least two witnesses, who will\ncertify that they heard the public reading of the\nDeclaration of Faith. <br><br>\n\nThe applicant must also pose for a photograph, in\nthose instances where a Church Officer is not present.\n In this photograph, the applicant sits down in a\nchair, and places a pineapple on top of his head. <br><br> \n\nIf the pineapple balances on top of the head without\nfalling off, that is a sign that the Declarant has\nbeen doubly blessed, and is eligible for advancement\ninto the senior ranks of the Ministry.  In most cases,\nholding the pineapple on top of the head with one hand\nis customary since the pineapple does not always\nbalance. <br><br>\n\nIf the pineapple balances of its own accord, the\nDeclarant is then awarded a DOUBLE portion of funding,\nas that such a person is truly blessed, and will need\nthe extra funding. <br><br>\n\nAt present we have US$30,680 available for a Ministry\nin Africa.  If you apply, and can be photographed with\nthe pineapple on top of your head without aid of\neither hand, (that is, the pineapple balances on your\nhead without falling off), then the available amount\nwill be $61,360, with the extra coming out of our\nGeneral Fund. \n\nIt is at this time, more convenient if you apply for\nmembership using two witnesses, rather than having\nmyself or another Church Officer come to Africa to\nwitness your Declaration.

After\nconsulting with other Committee Members, our findings\nare as follows: \n\nPeter Chukwueke's photograph was in order.  The\nDeclarations of Witness were not.  Until the Rules\nCommittee dictates otherwise, overseas applicants must\nprovide two separate Declarations of Witness. \n\nLately, the Rules Committee has been concerned about\nfraudulent applications.  The Rules Committee will\nsoon be publishing new guidelines for overseas\napplicants. \n\nIn light of these anticipated changes, which may be\ngoing into effect immediately, it is STRONGLY\nRECOMMENDED that you have Peter Chukwueke do the\nfollowing: \n\nHave Peter pose again in a chair, with a pineapple on\ntop of his head. His two witnesses must also appear in\nthe photograph, also seated in chairs.  His two\nwitnesses must also have pineapples on top of their\nheads. \n\nPeter must be seated between these two witnesses.  One\nwitness must be seated on Peter's left, and the other\nwitness must be seated on Peter's right. \n\nAll persons in the photgraph may balance the pineapple\non their heads.  If they do, that is an extra\nblessing.  Peter would then be eligible for a double\nfunding for his Ministry, and the two witnesses each\nwill receive $500 if the pineapple balances on their\nhead without using their hands to hold the pineapples.\n\n\nIf all persons in the photograph do not balance the\npineapple, then they may hold the pineapple on their\nhead, but then all of them must use their right hand\nto hold the pineapple. \n\nPlease pass these instructions along to Peter, and do\nnot leave out a single word.  I expect that the Rules\nCommittee will make these changes official sometime\nthis week. \n\nBy the way, if Peter does provide the new photograph,\nI will call the Committee into special session to\napprove his application, so that he will not have to\nwait until next month...but that is only if he\nprovides the new photograph. \n\nremain blessed, \nTom Foolery \n\nPS: I forgot to tell you that your sermon yesterday\nwas excellent!  Unfortunately there are too many\npeople who follow in the ways of the Grand Nagus of\nFerenginar.  Does the Grand Nagus operate in Africa? \nAre there any Ferengi in Africa?

The Rules Committee will\nsoon be publishing new guidelines for overseas\napplicants. <br><br>\n\nIn light of these anticipated changes, which may be\ngoing into effect immediately, it is STRONGLY\nRECOMMENDED that you have Peter Chukwueke do the\nfollowing: <br><br>\n\nHave Peter pose again in a chair, with a pineapple on\ntop of his head. His two witnesses must also appear in\nthe photograph, also seated in chairs.  His two\nwitnesses must also have pineapples on top of their\nheads. <br><br>\n\nPeter must be seated between these two witnesses.  One\nwitness must be seated on Peter's left, and the other\nwitness must be seated on Peter's right. <br><br>\n\nAll persons in the photgraph may balance the pineapple\non their heads.  If they do, that is an extra\nblessing.  Peter would then be eligible for a double\nfunding for his Ministry, and the two witnesses each\nwill receive $500 if the pineapple balances on their\nhead without using their hands to hold the pineapples.\n<br><br>\n\nIf all persons in the photograph do not balance the\npineapple, then they may hold the pineapple on their\nhead, but then all of them must use their right hand\nto hold the pineapple. <br><br>\n\nPlease pass these instructions along to Peter, and do\nnot leave out a single word.  I expect that the Rules\nCommittee will make these changes official sometime\nthis week. <br><br>\n\nBy the way, if Peter does provide the new photograph,\nI will call the Committee into special session to\napprove his application, so that he will not have to\nwait until next month...but that is only if he\nprovides the new photograph. <br><br>\n\nremain blessed,<br> \nTom Foolery <br><br>\n\nPS: I forgot to tell you that your sermon yesterday\nwas excellent!  Unfortunately there are too many\npeople who follow in the ways of the Grand Nagus of\nFerenginar.  Does the Grand Nagus operate in Africa? \nAre there any Ferengi in Africa?
