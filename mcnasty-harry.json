There are amortization tables on the internet that real bankers avail themselves to in order to figure interest.  I have included such a chart and figures below.  I suggest that before you make any other loans that you and your associates acquaint yourselves with such charts and have a rudimentary knowledge of banking before lending money in the future. \n \nYou are a poor excuse for a banker to say the least.

I asked to borrow $150,000 at 3% interest and you want me to pay back over $1.33 million dollars???  That's some kind of interest my friend.  $1182538.19 to be exact or 788% total interest over the life of the loan.  What kind of a joke are you trying to play anyway?  There are amortization tables on the internet that real bankers avail themselves to in order to figure interest.  I have included such a chart and figures below.  I suggest that before you make any other loans that you and your associates acquaint yourselves with such charts and have a rudimentary knowledge of banking before lending money in the future. <br /><br />\n \nYou are a poor excuse for a banker to say the least.  Once again you have asked for information that I have previously supplied or is reflected on the credit report you initiated before I received loan approval. You did run a credit check on me didn't you?  I am not used to doing business with such incompetents.<br /><br />\n \n If you care to have my business please revise your figures to reflect the proper amortization of a $150,000 loan at 3% interest.  I will ask you for the THIRD AND FINAL TIME. DOES THE RULE OF 72s APPLY TO THIS LOAN.  I HATE TO THROW STONES AT AN UNARMED MAN BUT CLEARLY THERE IS SOMETHING TERRIBLY WRONG WITH YOUR BANK AND BANKING PRACTICES.<br /><br />\n \nI await your reply<br /><br />\n \nFilthy McNasty<br /><br

I asked specifically about:\n\n\n1. The rule of 72 and how it applies to this loan.  This will be the fourth time I have posed this question to \n     you.  No response\n2.  I asked for a copy of the credit report you ran on me. You have furnished none.\n3.  I asked for the bank lending documents pertaining to the loan.  Once again none were furnished.\n4.  I asked you to explain why a new loan must be transfered.  No response\n\n\nHow could you read and make note of all this yet not respond??????\n\n\nPreviously I corrected an incorrect amortization schedule that your associated used to try and trick me in to repaying 1.33 Million Dollars on a $150,000 loan.  I am beginning to see a pattern of incompetence emerging here from your so called lending institution.  Do you mean to tell me that you and your board of directors at your alleged institution would approve a loan without running a credit check??? \n\n\n I have previously furnished all the information you need to run a credit check.  Why at this late date has this not been accomplished.  All lending institutions do this BEFORE loan approval.\n\n\nQuite frankly I am tired of all this childs play and not receiving any results from your end.  I am sure given the type of treatment I have received so far, that if there was ever a problem with the loan that your people would be too stupid to comprehend the nature of my request.  They screwed up big time on the interest and payment schedule.  Maybe like you they would just ignore the questions posed to them.  I don't like the idea of having to send payments to a foreign entity by Western Union.  Your receiving department is probably too dumb to post them to my account anyway.\n\n\nThe bottom line here is that your firm has done nothing but screw up from the beginning and offers no real advantages to me as a businessman.  I can borrow money all day from others offering better interest rates and surely even an idiot can offer better customer service.  Therefore I am not interested in obtaining a loan from you.

I asked for a copy of the credit report you ran on me. You have furnished none.<br />\n3.  I asked for the bank lending documents pertaining to the loan.  Once again none were furnished.<br />\n4.  I asked you to explain why a new loan must be transfered.  No response\n</p>\n \n<p>\nHow could you read and make note of all this yet not respond??????\n</p>\n \n<p>\nPreviously I corrected an incorrect amortization schedule that your associated used to try and trick me in to repaying 1.33 Million Dollars on a $150,000 loan.  I am beginning to see a pattern of incompetence emerging here from your so called lending institution.  Do you mean to tell me that you and your board of directors at your alleged institution would approve a loan without running a credit check??? \n</p>\n \n<p>\n I have previously furnished all the information you need to run a credit check.  Why at this late date has this not been accomplished.  All lending institutions do this BEFORE loan approval.\n</p>\n \n<p>\nQuite frankly I am tired of all this childs play and not receiving any results from your end.  I am sure given the type of treatment I have received so far, that if there was ever a problem with the loan that your people would be too stupid to comprehend the nature of my request.  They screwed up big time on the interest and payment schedule.  Maybe like you they would just ignore the questions posed to them.  I don't like the idea of having to send payments to a foreign entity by Western Union.  Your receiving department is probably too dumb to post them to my account anyway.\n</p>\n \n<p>\nThe bottom line here is that your firm has done nothing but screw up from the beginning and offers no real advantages to me as a businessman.  I can borrow money all day from others offering better interest rates and surely even an idiot can offer better customer service.  Therefore I am not interested in obtaining a loan from you.  Given the treatment I received I venture to say you will not be in business very long.\n</p>\n \n \n<p>\nFilthy McNasty\n</p>\n\n \n<p class=\"fmc\">\nMr Quency Quincy Harry did not respond to my last correspondence.\n</p>\n\n\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n <!--- end of middle table division -->\n</td>\n\n<td width=15%>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>\n<center>\n<p>\n<font size=-1>\n<a href=\"http://www.scamorama.com\"><b>scamorama main street</b></a> \n* \n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1932857389?ie=UTF8&tag=wwwscamoramco-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1932857389\" target=\"blank\"><b>get booked</b></a><img src=\"http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wwwscamoramco-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1932857389\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\" /> \n* \n", "comments": []}]}
