So, for example, we got all this little beautiful state-of-the-art laptop computer which allows us instantationeously to connect with the internet, and acces our central server system! And it just fits in the pocket of your jacket! Isn't this technology simply marvellous?   \n\nThe good thing about it is that I also am able to contact you in between this hectic situation and at this unconventional hour of the day.You know, because of the jet-lag I lost my sense of time a little. That is the only little trouble I have with our firm's international endives! These endives just screw up my biological timing.  \nAs I explained to you in my previous letter, this wedding plan with my beloved Bo Nobo is throwing up in my face and it more an more looks like becoming a great financial burden which will be too heavy to carry. And that is why you are the shining light in the darkness of my personal trouble, saving me from impending disaster!  \nSo that is why, we MUST go ahead with our project because I am in dare need to sanify my present position and personal finances.  \nHence, I URGE you to let me know how to further proceed!   \n\nAlthough I will be travelling internationally quite extensively, I am trying to do all that is necessary to keep in touch regularly. Fortunatly, very fortunatly, as I explained before, my company provides this extremely sophisticated means to allow us to set up super efficient global communication.   \n\nSo far I suggested to contact the hospital to enquire about the body and personal belongings. But you appear not to approve of this suggestion. I guess you must have been able to recover their personal belongings when you obtained the death certificate that you send to me?  \nMaybe I could contact Chevron? They for sure can be of assistance with your deal.  \nSo, I am anxious to the success of our deal and I am trying to make suggestions to be of your assistance.  \nI remember that you told me that I am to play a pivoting role in this undertaking, however, upto now the details of this pivoting are not clear at all!  \nThat is why I ask you URGENTLY to provide me with further details, so that we can coordinate our future actions in the most efficient way possible.

So nowthat I am waiting in the airport for my airplane, I am taking the time get in touch with you. \n  \nYou may wonder why I asked the question about confidentiality? But I think you are not aware of my precarious position to this respect, so let me explain myself so as to elucidate the issue of confidentiality to you. Than you will also understand that why the suggested procedure causes indeed increased complexity of execution. So in order to provide proper articulation, I may repeat some things I said before. However, this is necessary for utmost clear understanding of the complex problems on our path to succesful carrying out this deal.   \n\nNow, as I explained before, my business firm has developped this highly sofisticated means of global communication through what we call in our business firm the \"Electronic Post Office\" system (which I will call EPO system for convenience of writing). This EPO systems handles all information flow in our firm: telephone calls, fax, telex, email and normal mail. In handling this information almost no people are involved, everything happens ELECTRONICALLY. Even the regular mail is treated in an electronic way!  \n\nFor example to illustrate the level of sophistication, let me give you an example: I mentioned before that we can make use of this state-of-the-art satelite connection device. If you look at the picture you will notice that the top part serves for connecting physically with the laptop computer. The bottom part comprises three independent satelite receivers. Once you want to activate the satelite connection, each receiver tracks an independent satelite for secure information exchange. However, upon making the connection, also the Global Positioning System is activated. In this way the head office keeps track of the whereabouts of its employers and is being able to monitor all exchanges that occur.   \n\nSo, back to the issue of confidentiality. I understand that no secretary should be involved by sending the fax for me. However, as I mention above, for business purposes and customer satisfaction ALL our means of communication are being globally monitored and centrally recorded by our EPO system, except for acronymified email accounts and regular mail labeled \"personal/confidential\". For your information and peace of mind, I am presently using such an acronymified email account, so it is perfectly secure.  \nAs you now may realise, my problem of confidentiality is very complex and I am actively thinking about ways to get around it. Once, I am in Europe, I'll drop by our EPO system administrator to see if I can set up another secure means of communication. Untill than I am afraid that the only secure and confidential way to communicate is via my acronymified email account. \n  \nSo, I am very much willing to get in touch with the bank that you mentioned to me, but than you need to provide me with the correct email addres of the person in charge of dealing with the issues of our late Mr. Williams.  \nI hope you know have a better understanding of the complex problem of confidentiality in my business firm and that we may have to resort to not so cenventional means of secure communication. \n  \nThan by studying your procedure, I notice that there is a second aspect I need to take care off for good coordination of our mutual actions. Namely, I need to make the necessary arrangements with my bank in order to get an account ready for receiving the money. As I know the bank manager of our private company financial institution very well, this should not be a big problem. However, I will have to enquire under covered terms how they would treat such cases because it relates essentially to a transfer of private funds and not business funds. And I have to extract from them whether they will need some documents for legal purposes. Because I will be in Europe soon, I'll be able to talk informally with my friend at the bank and see what is needed to correctly set up everything for receiving the funds that will be transferred in order to avoid any mistakes and misunderstanding at a later stage of the process. \n  \nHoping to have clrafied my precarious position,  \nyours sincerly,  \nR.E.Etkever", "raw": "<hr><span class=\"re\">R.E.

Untill than I am afraid that the only secure and confidential way to communicate is via my acronymified email account. \n <br> <br>\nSo, I am very much willing to get in touch with the bank that you mentioned to me, but than you need to provide me with the correct email addres of the person in charge of dealing with the issues of our late Mr. Williams.  <br>\nI hope you know have a better understanding of the complex problem of confidentiality in my business firm and that we may have to resort to not so cenventional means of secure communication. \n <br> <br>\nThan by studying your procedure, I notice that there is a second aspect I need to take care off for good coordination of our mutual actions. Namely, I need to make the necessary arrangements with my bank in order to get an account ready for receiving the money. As I know the bank manager of our private company financial institution very well, this should not be a big problem. However, I will have to enquire under covered terms how they would treat such cases because it relates essentially to a transfer of private funds and not business funds. And I have to extract from them whether they will need some documents for legal purposes. Because I will be in Europe soon, I'll be able to talk informally with my friend at the bank and see what is needed to correctly set up everything for receiving the funds that will be transferred in order to avoid any mistakes and misunderstanding at a later stage of the process. \n <br> <br>\nHoping to have clrafied my precarious position,  <br>\nyours sincerly,  <br>\nR.E.Etkever \n</span><br><br>\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "", "author_role": "scam", "body": "I appreciate your work load, but you need to get focused on this transaction, Since its difficult for you to send a fax now ,you can send an email to the Bank, Find out their email from their website http://www.firstatlantics.com,the \nEmail Address of Bank is  \ninfo@firstatlantics.com  \nThere  is no particular officer in the bank that is In charge of Mr. Williams Case, Just Contact the Bank today via email, so that they know that you are serious in getting your brothers money. \nIn terms of Confidentiality, there should be a high degree of it, your secretary can send faxes to the bank, but they should not know that you are not the real Next Of Kin to Mr. Williams.. \nLet me have your details to enable me draft the Agreement and other relevant documents. \nTreat as Urgent. \nJT", "raw": "<hr><span class=\"jt\">JIDE TIAWO</span><br><br><span class=\"st\">\n\nI appreciate your work load, but you need to get focused on this transaction, Since its difficult for you to send a fax now ,you can send an email to the Bank, Find out their email from their website http://www.firstatlantics.com,the <br>\nEmail Address of Bank is  <br>\ninfo@firstatlantics.com  <br>\nThere  is no particular officer in the bank that is In charge of Mr. Williams Case, Just Contact the Bank today via email, so that they know that you are serious in getting your brothers money. \nIn terms of Confidentiality, there should be a high degree of it, your secretary can send faxes to the bank, but they should not know that you are not the real Next Of Kin to Mr. Williams.. \nLet me have your details to enable me draft the Agreement and other relevant documents. <br>\nTreat as Urgent. <br>\nJT \n</span><br><br>\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "", "author_role": "bait", "body": "Dear Mr. C.O.

Not that these documents will be used for any further investigation, they only serve to show that the bank from her side has done everything legal within their possibilities. \n\nDr. Sezaar further explained to me that there are two phases setting up an account for such matters and each phase needs to be backed up by official documents. \nNow, the two phases are: \n1) opening the account \n2) transferring the money \n\nFor the second phase regarding the money transfer Dr. Sezaar told me that the bank will request a certain number of documents, namely: \n1) Death Certificate \n2) Legacy statement \n3) Legal authorisation from the Ministry Department of Legal Affairs \n4) Official claim document certified by the Court at the residence address of the bank. \nI have the impression that these documents more or less correspond with the documents you appear to need for processing the claim at Firstatlantics bank.

I told them that Mr. Williams died in an accident, but they answered that dying does not destroy his identity documents (typical administration logic, isn't it?). \n6) the bank will also want a copy of a certain document entitled \"Permitting Licence for Expatriates\".  \n\nThan finally, Dr. Sezaar also informed me that there will be costs associated with opening such an account as well as administrative costs for processing the legal documents. Actually, it doesn't mean anything, just that they will charge us a certain amount of money for setting up the account. As I have such a good business contact with you upto now, I don't want you alone to carry the burden of all these costs and I suggest we can split the cost 50/50. Dr. Sezaar could not tell me as of yet the exact costs involved. The exacts costs will only be known at the moment of starting effectively the procedure of setting up the account.

As evidence he listed of course the wedding contract, but apparently also simple material evidence such as for example a wedding ring would be sufficient to proving that Mr. Williams was married. It would be interesting if you could obtain such evidence and having it ready for when it will be necessary. \n\nAs you can see, I have made important progress in organising our deal, \nand I am looking forward to further receiving your information, \nplease send me all of the above listed documents so as to being able to start my part of the duties, \nIn the mean time I'll try to contact our EPO systems administrator to figure out a secure way in which we can confidentially exchange financial and other correspondence related to our deal. \n\n\nyours sincerely, \nR.E.Etkever", "raw": "<hr>\n<span class=\"rec\">Now I start trying to get some more fake documents from Mr. Tiawo: \n</span><br><br>\n\n<span class=\"re\">R.E.

As I explained to you previously the Electronic Post Office (EPO) system operates completely in a digital way. Regular mail is scanned and automatically relayed to the right person. If a person is not in his office, the system will forward the mail to the place where he presently is thanks to the tri-satellite detecting remote online connector which is activated once our laptop computer is switched on. However, such mail is not secure and may be opened by go-between people such as secretaries, bosses, directors, etc. \nI asked my friend if it would be possible to receive mail through our EPO system which is entirely secure. He at first objected that it could interfere with business purposes, but he finally was willing to enable the EPO system to accept such secure mail. \nAt the end of my mail it will be explained how our secure way of communication needs to be carried out. Don't be scared at first, because it may seem complex. However, once we check good working of this way of communicating, you will see that it is in fact very simple. The most difficult part is that the mail you are sending me should have the correct lay-out and format for the EPO system in order for the EPO computer to recognize that it is secure mail intended for me. \nTo check the working of this way of communication, I would suggest that you send me a card/photograph with a secret sentence so that you have a double security check (visual and writing). Once I receive your letter, I will email the secret sentence to you as well as tell you what image is on the card or picture and if it is correct we know that this mode of communication works. \nPlease, I would urge you to read VERY CAREFULLY the instructions below and to carry them out with utmost care for detail! If one single aspect is missing, the EPO system will detect it as a security failure and reject the mail. \n\nlooking forward to receiving your test letter, \nyours sincerely, \nR.E.Etkever \n\n\nDetails for secure communication: \n1) the size of the letter or package should be 29.8 cm long and 21 cm wide. This is actually the German DIN A4 size of a letter. The thickness of the letter/package is not important. \n2) put the A4 size in landscape position. \n3) On the right side of the A4 area you should draw in black ink a rectangle at 3 cm from the right side and 3 cm from the bottom side. The rectangle should be 10 cm wide and 10 cm long. \n4) INSIDE the rectangle in the LEFT UPPER corner you should write the following words in capital letters, style helvetica: PERSONAL - PRIVATE. This is a security matter in case a problem should occur within the EPO system requiring manual handling. \n5) INSIDE the rectangle in the right lower corner you should write the following encrypted code in helvetica style: \n        jmcdonalds \n        <*D-1234*><*R-1234*> \n        EPO \n        D-8**** Mnchen \n        GERMANY \n        \n(For your understanding: <jmcdonalds> is as you already know an encrypted digital code, <*D-1234*><*R-1234*> is a secondary security code which is needed for double checking the existence and validity of the encrypted code, <EPO> obviously stands for Electronic Post Office, and <D-8**** Mnchen> is the postal code for our Electronic Post Office system within Germany. As you may notice, there is no street name involved because of the electronic and digital treatment!) \n\nNow comes the important part where you have to take extreme care! In order to establish 100% secure treatment you should put a special code onto the letter/package. Very exceptionally my friend has provided such a code for our purpose of secure information. This code has been put in a special format so that the EPO system when scanning the letter/package can detect that this specific mail needs special treatment. Therefore in addition to my encrypted name code, my friend has warped the secure code into special multidimensional visual encrypted thrustors. It is of utmost importance that you place those multidimensional visual encrypted thrustors correctly otherwise the code will be warped out and the EPO system will reject the mail. When scanned by the EPO system a tridimensional link will be created thanks to these encrypted thrustors and the warped code will be de-warped by the central processing unit of our EPO mainframe. Upon de-warping the code will be transformed by a Markowski function into a computer generated frame which ensure further secure treatment. \n\n6) Now, the first thrustor containing the first part of the warped code is the following: \n\n \nThis first thrustor should be place in the UPPER LEFT corner of the A4 inlandscape format (frontside, where you wrote the encrypted address). As you will notice upon looking at this thrustor, you will vagely see photonic embedded information flashing back and forth between the different integrated intersections. \n\n7) The second thrustor (below) should be placed in the BOTTOM LEFT corner of the A4 inlandscape format (frontside, where you wrote the encrypted address). Please make sure that both the first and the second thrustor are centered above each other. The second thrustor imparts the linear photonic embedded information flashing back and forth between the integrated intersections of the first thrustor with a frequenced wave like motion. This brings the embedded information into a square warp mode which will allow in the next stage an oscillation into the third dimension, needed for the EPO computer to intiate the final de-warp process. \n\n\n8) The third thrustor should be placed on the BACKSIDE in the CENTER!!! This is necessary to establish the three dimensional link between the three thrustors. The third thrustor will impart the information with a spiralling motion which is focused in a self-enforcing fashion onto the central disc. As you can see when looking at the thrustor it also contains further moving and delocalised photonic embedded information within the spiraling lines which will enable the computer to access and transgress into the cubic warp mode. Once the photonic embedded information has transgressed from the square warp mode into the cubic warp mode and after condensing in the focal Bose-Einstein condensator point of the central disc of the third thrustor, the computer will be able to launch the de-warping process.", "raw": "<hr><span class=\"re\">R.E.

This is a security matter in case a problem should occur within the EPO system requiring manual handling. <br>\n5) INSIDE the rectangle in the right lower corner you should write the following encrypted code in helvetica style: <br>\n        jmcdonalds <br>\n        &lt;*D-1234*&gt;&lt;*R-1234*&gt; <br>\n        EPO <br>\n        D-8**** Mnchen <br>\n        GERMANY \n        <br><br>\n(For your understanding: &lt;jmcdonalds&gt; is as you already know an encrypted digital code, &lt;*D-1234*&gt;&lt;*R-1234*&gt; is a secondary security code which is needed for double checking the existence and validity of the encrypted code, &lt;EPO&gt; obviously stands for Electronic Post Office, and &lt;D-8**** Mnchen&gt; is the postal code for our Electronic Post Office system within Germany. As you may notice, there is no street name involved because of the electronic and digital treatment!) <br><br>\n\nNow comes the important part where you have to take extreme care! In order to establish 100% secure treatment you should put a special code onto the letter/package. Very exceptionally my friend has provided such a code for our purpose of secure information. This code has been put in a special format so that the EPO system when scanning the letter/package can detect that this specific mail needs special treatment. Therefore in addition to my encrypted name code, my friend has warped the secure code into special multidimensional visual encrypted thrustors. It is of utmost importance that you place those multidimensional visual encrypted thrustors correctly otherwise the code will be warped out and the EPO system will reject the mail. When scanned by the EPO system a tridimensional link will be created thanks to these encrypted thrustors and the warped code will be de-warped by the central processing unit of our EPO mainframe. Upon de-warping the code will be transformed by a Markowski function into a computer generated frame which ensure further secure treatment. \n<br><br>\n6) Now, the first thrustor containing the first part of the warped code is the following: <br><br>\n\n<img src=\"images/etkever_tiawo_squares.jpg\"><br><br>\n \nThis first thrustor should be place in the UPPER LEFT corner of the A4 inlandscape format (frontside, where you wrote the encrypted address). As you will notice upon looking at this thrustor, you will vagely see photonic embedded information flashing back and forth between the different integrated intersections. <br><br>\n\n7) The second thrustor (below) should be placed in the BOTTOM LEFT corner of the A4 inlandscape format (frontside, where you wrote the encrypted address). Please make sure that both the first and the second thrustor are centered above each other. The second thrustor imparts the linear photonic embedded information flashing back and forth between the integrated intersections of the first thrustor with a frequenced wave like motion. This brings the embedded information into a square warp mode which will allow in the next stage an oscillation into the third dimension, needed for the EPO computer to intiate the final de-warp process. <br><br>\n<img src=\"images/etkevier_tiawo_ripples.jpg\">\n\n<br><br>\n8) The third thrustor should be placed on the BACKSIDE in the CENTER!!! This is necessary to establish the three dimensional link between the three thrustors. The third thrustor will impart the information with a spiralling motion which is focused in a self-enforcing fashion onto the central disc. As you can see when looking at the thrustor it also contains further moving and delocalised photonic embedded information within the spiraling lines which will enable the computer to access and transgress into the cubic warp mode. Once the photonic embedded information has transgressed from the square warp mode into the cubic warp mode and after condensing in the focal Bose-Einstein condensator point of the central disc of the third thrustor, the computer will be able to launch the de-warping process. <br><br>\n</span>\n\n<img src=\"images/etkever_tiawo_spiral.jpg\">\n<br><br>\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "", "author_role": "bait", "body": "Dear Mr. Tiawo, \n\nI hope you received my message about the secure way of communicating.

This document should indicate that his deposit should be transferred to the person which is his Next of Kin. \n3) a copy of one photoidentification document (pasport, driver licence, etc.) of Mr. Williams \n\nIt took a hughe effort from my side to managed to convince Mr Sezaar that a copy of your lawyer diplome and evidence of your seasoning is not really necessary.

I also convinced him that the document \"Permitting Licence for Expatriates\" would not bring very much.

So don't hesitate to send me as soon as possible any other documents that come into your possession. \n\nMr Sezaar told me that strangely enough that 56% of the cost could be waived if we can provide some material evidence of Mr. Williams being married. I am sure that since you are Mr. Williams lawyer, the officials conferred some of the possessions of Mr. Williams in to your caretaking. Mr. Sezaar told me that if you would be able to send Mr. Williams wedding ring than at least 56% of the costs could be waived! Luckily I set up our secure means of communication, so it should not be a big problem for you to send me his wedding ring in order to decrease the costs associated with our project.

At that point Mr. Sezaar became extremely suspiscious and said that he would refuse any further action untill you could provide detailed clarification! Actually, I did not realize the fact that both documents are different, but Mr. Sezaar certainly has a good point there. Actually, I am also extremely disappointed because all my hughe efforts and energy disappeared into thin air by this! Mr. Tiawo, we have been good business partners and I consider you as a very thrustworthy person. But I have put a lot of effort in this case by already setting up the all the means to enable the money transfer, so I think you owe me a detailed explanation and evidence of your good faith in this matter.

At that time Mr. I.K.Benne was not involved in our project. <br>\nI assume that when you send me a statement from the Chef Medical Officer, Mr. Sezaar would not have further problems to finalize the setting up of the bank account. <br>\nSo please send me the validated statement from the Chef Medical Officer as soon as possible! <br>\nI am eager to unlock this unfortunate situation so that we can carry out our project in due time. \n\n</span><br><br>\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "", "author_role": "bait", "body": "Dear Mr. Tiawo,  I just got a message from the bank that the limit for reimbursement of costs on the basis of receipts is 3700 EURO /month.

ETKEVER</span><br><br><span class=\"ast\">\n\nDear Mr. Tiawo, <br>\nwhat annoys me quite intensively is your lack of understanding for my predicaments over here. \nI can only make my moves within the fullfilment of basic adminstrative requirements. \nLately we were progressing very satisfactory. I made tremendeous progress in setting up everything over here to receive the money as well as providing you with substantial funding up to 3700 EURO/month to enable to finalize the project. <br>\nHowever, when it came to the final finishing touch you failed to support me in my efforts. \n<br><br>\nNow, let us stop jipjapping like little children and deal with this like real grown-up adults. You have your issues to tackle and I have my hurdles to take. So let us have some mutual understanding and support each other in order to get this thing sorted out. We both want to keep crawling around in the glasshouse, won't we? <br><br>\n\nI am very much willing to believe that you send me the original receipts by mail. However, I never received anything. So something must have gone wrong with the postal service. As I suggested earlier, it would have been better to send a test letter. However, at the present stage of matters, I suggest that in order to check what has gone wrong, you should send me a simple postcard with just the address which I will give you again below. The card will than follow the insecure postal procedure. You can just write any simple greeting message.

I can imagine that something went wrong with the secure mailing procedure as I assume it must be quite complex to send such letters from a country like Nigeria which is located in the middle of dark Africa. <br>\nSo please, I would urge you to send a simple post card from your area with a greeting message to: \n<br><br>\n        jmcdonalds <br>\n        &lt;*D-1234*&gt;&lt;*R-1234*&gt; <br>\n        EPO <br>\n        D-8**** Mnchen <br>\n        GERMANY <br><br>\nI am hoping that we now have more mutual understanding for each others predicaments and that we will support each other in our efforts to get this project going again.\n</span><br><br>\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "", "author_role": "bait", "body": "Dear Mr. Tiawo, \nplease let me know how things are going.", "raw": "<hr><span class=\"re\">R.E.
