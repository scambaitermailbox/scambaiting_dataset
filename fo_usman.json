be monitoring you in so many ways both in sending you proposal letter and calls in disguise as the monitoring unit that was setted up in the bank started their activities today as I can witness from all indication here in the bank today, so please do not respond to any strange email that you receive from any angle as they are the banks monitoring unit and responding to them will jeopardize all our effort so far in making this fund which I don't think that I will be alive to witness owning to what and how I have spent and suffered to gather information related to this fund and also please I still plead with you to have  this transaction as a top secret till we receive this fund into your account as you are aware that the fund in question does not belong to us rather we are trying to grab this all seeking opportunity that God have schedule for the bright future of our families as I only believe that this is not the hand work of man rather it is divine as I have worked with this bank for so many years without achieving anything so I wont in any way miss this opportunity because of anything.\n <br /><br />\nComing to your mail please my dear I am sure that you have not yet responded to them, as I will like to have a look at the mail and the attachment that they sent to you so that I will advice you more on what to do and how to follow  to avoid any kind of mistakes.<br /><br />\n \nSo please do forward every thing that you received from the bank to me so that I will carefully go through it and advice you more but please Captain George on no account should you let the bank to now that I am the one giving you all this information's about this fund as that will be of a great harm to me.<br /><br />\n \nWaiting to hear from you urgently.<br /><br />\n \nMr B

10am by the director himself at first i was\nupseted but i later realized that it was due to the answers that you\nsent to them, as from the words of the director he was not happy at all\nabout the delay as he said that the answer was received from you\nyesterday notwithstanding  the instruction that he gave to the\nsecreatary to give you the mandate of 3 banking  days to comply with\ntheir directives.<br /><br />\n\nNevertheless i was happy that his anger did not extend so much rather he\ncalled up the meeting to inform the board official about the\ninformations that was received from you  and he also delivered the\ninformations to our information manager to verify all the answer so\nplease my dear i want you to stay on alert as the bank will contact you\nanytime from now and i am sure that they will surely approve this fund\nwith those answers as i am sure that i got them from the right source\nthough i costed me a lot but i beleive that what is in the furture is\nfar more better that what ever we spend in this transaction.<br /><br />\n\nComing to my demand please i only need to be sure of your sincerity of\npurpose to accomplise this with me in true faith and never
