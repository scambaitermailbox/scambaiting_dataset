Combined with you and Mr. Benbols, the stress may just be too much.\n<br><br>\nSo, please, do not quit! I do not want anyone to become more angry or more beavers to come in to my house!<br><br>\n\nLizzie\n<br><br>\n\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "2005-07-06 00:00", "subject": "", "author_role": "scam", "body": "I was expecting to hear that you have made the payment.If you have not,then go and so immediately because if you do not make that payment i will get started as i will not use other client's money to do your job for you.\nTry as much as possible to make the payment today and give me the transfer informations so that my secretary can cash the money here.Remember the name and address i gave you.\nYou must be very rude to tell me that someone else asked you to beg me.That means you are not even sorry within yourself,you can keep your stupid apology,just make the payment or else,i will not do anything for you.The earlier you do that,the better for you.\nDAN EZE.", "raw": "<hr><font face=\"Georgia,Arial,Verdana\"><b><font  color=\"brown\"><i>Dan Eze</i></font></b><br><br>\n\nDate:  6/7/2005<br><br>\n\nI was expecting to hear that you have made the payment.If you have not,then go and so immediately because if you do not make that payment i will get started as i will not use other client's money to do your job for you.<br>\nTry as much as possible to make the payment today and give me the transfer informations so that my secretary can cash the money here.Remember the name and address i gave you.<br>\nYou must be very rude to tell me that someone else asked you to beg me.That means you are not even sorry within yourself,you can keep your stupid apology,just make the payment or else,i will not do anything for you.The earlier you do that,the better for you.<br>\nDAN EZE.\n<br><br>\n\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "2005-07-06 00:00", "subject": "", "author_role": "bait", "body": "Mr. Ezenad,\n\nI came to you humbly and with apologies and begged for you not to quit, and you just call me rude because I did not use the right words!?
