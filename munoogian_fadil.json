Wonderful! Hang in there, my friend. I know things may seem bleak, and really they are. But the treasure of heaven awaits you at the end. We can only do the best we can on this earth. \n\nI know the pain you've been going through must be horrible as you drag yourself out of bed to type on the computer each time. And yes, the pain of the tube in the bum is something I do not like to think about alone. I remember on one day, the nurse at the hospital forgot to put lubricant on the tube. She struggled for almost 20 minutes as she tried to stuff that uncomfortable thing up my bum! Oh, the pain as I sit here and think back about it! Has this happened to you yet? Tell me how it affected you - sharing mutual stories of our pain helps put my mind at ease. And always make sure your nurse uses lubricant on the tube when she tries to put it in your bum!\n\nAs for my dogs, they are wonderful creatures. I have had them compete in many dog shows over the years. The last time we won was sometime during the mid 1980's. It was only a small contest at a show in West Covina. We won fourth place and many cans of dog food. Although, at the time, and I'm ashamed to admit, I didn't realize those cans were dog food. I ended up eating about 6 cans worth in various stews and meat loaves before I looked at the label and found out the shocking truth! However, in hindsight, it wasn't actually too bad tasting. And occasionally, I will share in some of my dogs' meals. Oh, Fadil! I'm so ashamed to admit this to you! Please do not think lowly of me, ok?\n\nAnyway, regarding my dogs and the latest competitions, I have become so irate and aggravated that they have not been winning any medals in any dog shows for a long time. So, I had begun a rule over 5 years ago. Any one dog that loses three times in a row must be killed immediately. I simply have my servant bring the animal to our back stables and he shoots it in the head. No dog that lives for free under my roof and not winning any medals will be allowed to continue to do so. I'm sure you can understand, Fadil, the reasons why I do this. Life is just too short to cater to loser dogs! Well, I hope someday they start winning again because it is getting tiresome to go through so many dogs. But I love them so!\n\nWhat kind of dogs do you own, Fadil? Please tell me all about them. Like I said before, I only want to do business with real dog lovers. What are your favorite breeds and how many medals have your dogs won in the dog shows you have competed in? Surely any dog lover like yourself must be competing in many of these events and by God's good grace, you must have won at least a few medals.\n\n\n\nNow, about Frederick Webber, I am concerned that if I contact him directly, he will not know who I am. Who am I to say that I am the new beneficiary? You see what I mean, yes? Please contact him yourself and have him email me. I will be looking forward to hearing from him.

I ended up eating about 6 cans worth in various stews and meat loaves before I looked at the label and found out the shocking truth! However, in hindsight, it wasn't actually too bad tasting. And occasionally, I will share in some of my dogs' meals. Oh, Fadil! I'm so ashamed to admit this to you! Please do not think lowly of me, ok?\n<br><br>\nAnyway, regarding my dogs and the latest competitions, I have become so irate and aggravated that they have not been winning any medals in any dog shows for a long time. So, I had begun a rule over 5 years ago. Any one dog that loses three times in a row must be killed immediately. I simply have my servant bring the animal to our back stables and he shoots it in the head. No dog that lives for free under my roof and not winning any medals will be allowed to continue to do so. I'm sure you can understand, Fadil, the reasons why I do this. Life is just too short to cater to loser dogs! Well, I hope someday they start winning again because it is getting tiresome to go through so many dogs. But I love them so!\n<br><br>\nWhat kind of dogs do you own, Fadil? Please tell me all about them. Like I said before, I only want to do business with real dog lovers. What are your favorite breeds and how many medals have your dogs won in the dog shows you have competed in? Surely any dog lover like yourself must be competing in many of these events and by God's good grace, you must have won at least a few medals.\n<br><br>\n\n\nNow, about Frederick Webber, I am concerned that if I contact him directly, he will not know who I am. Who am I to say that I am the new beneficiary? You see what I mean, yes? Please contact him yourself and have him email me. I will be looking forward to hearing from him.

Our friendship, Fadil, has blossomed beyond my wildest imagination!. You are my best friend in the world. This you must know. In my country, we have a saying reserved especially for someone like this. It is called \"Best Friend Forever\" or BFF for short. It is a title of great honor and it is to be worn like a badge. Fadil, you are my BFF and I will now refer to you as this always and forever!<br><br>\n\nI wrote to you last time asking you about Lassy and Russell. But you have not responded to my inquiries. I know you said you have gotten over your loss of Lassy, but somehow I feel that you are still troubled by this as you no longer discuss such things involving dogs. It saddens me greatly to not hear any more stories about them. I truly wish you will continue telling me about them.\n<br><br>\nI'm not sure why I cannot get through to Frederic. I do not have a scanner for email document transfer. Like I said, I have tried that fax number and it is not working. Frederic asked to send him my passport which I am trying desperately, for your sake, to do. Oh, Fadil! Sometimes I feel like an old fuddy-duddy trying to figure out all this new technology! It took me so long just trying to learn how to use email. Please tell Frederic that I am doing all I can to get him the information that he has requested and that, God willing, it will arrive to him soon.<br><br>\n\nSo, here's what I am going to do. I am going to send my son, Tamany, to meet with you briefly. I may send him on my private jet. He will hand deliver my passport to you. Since you are able to get in contact with Frederic easily, I will leave it up to you to have your servant complete this task of sending my passport information to Frederic. Please tell me the name of the nearest international airport and the city it is in. Tamany can meet you (or one of your servants) at the airport, if need be. Then he can get right back on the plane if you don't care to spend any time with him. Tamany is not only my son, but he is also my errand-boy and always does exactly as I instruct him.<br><br>\n\nBest,<br><br>\n\nWade Munoogian\n</span><br><br>\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "",

I'm sorry Fadil! But my point is that it was a long list of many foods that these starving children will be able to eat once we get them the money.\n\n\n\nI am so sorry that you had to flee to Russia. I remember a similar circumstance when I worked as a bee keeper in South America. This was during a time in my youth when I didn't have much respect for the law and I lived a bit of a reckless life. I have since repented, as you have. Anyway, at the time, I was stealing bees from my employer for my own personal collection. Eventually, he caught me and brought me to a remote location in the forest. I was wearing a hood over my head so I could not see. Oh, Fadil! It was so scary! He took off the hood and asked me if I knew why I was there. I told him \"no.\" Then he had his cronies hang me upside down to empty my pockets. Many bees fell out in front of him! I was so afraid what would happen! He then proceeded to tie me to a nearby tree nearby, where I was standing nearby. He and his cronies all took turns putting hooks through my face! It hurt tremendously and left me terribly scarred! And that is also why sometimes I am so shy about going out in public, because these scars still exist. I fled that horrible place soon after and vowed never to go back.\n\nFadil, I'm sure you miss Lassy very much. You have professed your love for this animal.

It is customary in my country that one who earns the title of BFF from someone, and upon accepting it (which you have done), is obligated to bestow the BFF title to the person who gave it. Otherwise, it becomes an insult of the highest degree! So, I pray Fadil, that you have not meant to insult me.

Has he ever tried to claw your eyes out? That happened to me with the one cat I owned. Her name was \"Bluebell\" and I gave her away to a young child. Unfortunately, because of the incident, I can now only see the image of a claw mark out of my right eye.\n\nNow, speaking of that, it reminds me of something that has been bothering me from my last message.

I see that you have dropped my BFF title completely! That is perhaps the highest insult that one can make to another in a situation like this! When one drops BFF to nothing after he has been downgraded to FF, it shows extreme disrespect to the original BFF giver. It means that the FF does not care at all for his BFF and that he does not wish to try to regain BFF status. So, therefore, any positive things you said after you dropped my BFF status to nothing is automatically interpreted as a mockery of your former BFF. Sadly, that means that I was automatically required to downgrade your relatively meager FF status to nothing, which you can see at the top of this letter. And remember, Fadil, you cannot automatically reassign my BFF title until you have also achieved BFF status because you were the instigator of dropping my BFF title while you were trying to regain yours. The title assignments now fall upon the original giver of the BFF. Oh, Fadil! I hope you are taking notes on all of this so we are not in this situation again!\n\nI am so incredibly hurt by this betrayal, Fadil. I cried for three nights over this! I thought I was your BFF but now I see otherwise. You really must brush up on American customs so we can avoid this in the furture. Because now we must work extra hard to try to regain your BFF status. We'll first attempt FF status for you and then hopefully back to BFF status. Yes, it will be hard but I have faith in God and in you that we will achieve this once again. We have a business deal to finish and I desperately want to help you do that. You must attain BFF status again to complete the transaction. Time is of the essence so we must begin the process now!\n\nIn other news, yes, my laboratory is being rebuilt (not that you care). I will choose the perfect creatures for my experimentations. I cannot use the ones that you recommended because you told me that immediately after you stripped my BFF title which shows as that whole mockery thing. So, I will have to use other animals. I will start with a duck. Then perhaps a goose. Yes, they are lovely specimens. What do you think of them?
