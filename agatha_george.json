Here are the copy of  the approval from the bank issued in your favour for the sucessfull of  entire transaction.The fund will transfer VIA Diplomatic Means to Holand,You have to know that the nature this Business does not require your bank information It is important to inform you of the new development and onward arrangement we have put in place to ensure a successfully and confidential transaction. In view of the official banking process and procedures which made it impossible to transfer such huge sum  into your bank account through bank to bank, due to high monitoring of Terrorist Funding and Money Lundering in the world today by the united states and the International community based on the fact that all huge remittances from Africa are intercepted by the International Monetary Fund  and the Paris Club in this measure of new resolution, i must tell you that it is a trusted,reliable and thoroughly proven way to transfer such hug some out of the country/state.\nTherefore, we have resolved to using my official position to signing this fund CASH to OFFSHORE in Amsterdam-Holand for onward transfer into an account which shall be opened by you. This arrangement was concluded after a careful and confidential discussion with a DIPLOMAT, who has accepted to use his office as a means of transporting the cash consignment to Amsterdam-Holand where you will be expected to travel for claim and deposit in a bank as you will be directed and assisted.\nWith regards to the successful and accepted agreement reached between me and the diplomat who has agreed to use his diplomatic immunity for a FEE to transport the total sum as consignment to our agreed destination Amsterdam-Holand. As a diplomat his immunity granted him the RIGHT of transporting his personal effect through the AIRPORT or any BOARDER POST without passing through the security checks. We are glad for this new development as it is safe and convenient and most importantly confidential, hence it may not pass through different official process of signing and approval. Under this arrangement, the diplomat does not know the exact contents of the consignments, he only knows the contents as PRECIOUS METALS/FAMILY TRESURES.\nIn respect to the above arrangement, you are urgently requested to travel to Amsterdam-Holand to enable you claim the consignment and deposit into your bank account, in any case, a safe and conducive arrangement has been put in place for this purpose. Therefore,by this opportunity you are required to inform me of your schedule and readiness to travel to Amsterdam-Holand to also enable me arange for my cousin to meet with you in there  for more guldance. \nI must assure and reassure you that the diplomat who is conveying these money boxes to  you in Holand is not just an \"ordinary diplomat\" but a very senior and top United Nations official who happens to be one of the UN representatives.Infact I had to go through chains of procedures and hardships in order to secure the services .\nThis diplomat enjoys total UN immunity in any company's and bank representative, Regions, in the world. So it is therefore unneccessary for you to dwel or even think that the diplomat would be unable to accomplish his mission regarding this our transaction. I have his word on this and I assure you that the consignments will be routing to you in Holand safely in your favour and  again,I have to implore you to use your good office to arrange and consolidate my effort by making your schedules without entertaining any fears on how to recieve the diplomat in  Holand upon his arrival.\nOncemore,You will be receiving the funds through the Diplomatic attachee to United Nation Diplomatic Agent  who is a high powered diplomat and has the immunity to airlift the consignment of such while it's contained the total sum of  US$12.7Million which will routing to Standard Trust  Clearing House In Amsterdam-Holand. All your information will be giving to the diplomat to enable him communicate with you on his arrival for onward clearance by you as the beneficairy to the consignment.  As soon as the diplomat arrive he will call you so that you  so you can present yourself as the only legal representative to the consignment, So my own duty is to make all necessary arrangements and present you as the bonafide owner of the funds via legal means which had already reflected properly in the papers from the high Court issued in your favour, then your own duty is to Guide the diplomat until the consignment get to you safely. And this we must do and make sure that no mistake is made throughout the entire transaction.\nAs you can see, every thing about this transaction is almost coming to an end, all i needed from you now is your altmost cooperation as to ensure safe clearance of the consignment by the Diplomat who will deliver the consignment as ealier been told.  Be guided Accordingly that the Diplomat does not know the contents of the boxes, it was decleared to them as Family assets and to deliver as routed to the owner which is you,Never by mistake let him know that the contents are money, this is for security reasons.\nKindly respond to this message as soon as possible and give the phone number where you can be reached.

This arrangement was concluded after a careful and confidential discussion with a DIPLOMAT, who has accepted to use his office as a means of transporting the cash consignment to Amsterdam-Holand where you will be expected to travel for claim and deposit in a bank as you will be directed and assisted.<br><br>\nWith regards to the successful and accepted agreement reached between me and the diplomat who has agreed to use his diplomatic immunity for a FEE to transport the total sum as consignment to our agreed destination Amsterdam-Holand. As a diplomat his immunity granted him the RIGHT of transporting his personal effect through the AIRPORT or any BOARDER POST without passing through the security checks. We are glad for this new development as it is safe and convenient and most importantly confidential, hence it may not pass through different official process of signing and approval. Under this arrangement, the diplomat does not know the exact contents of the consignments, he only knows the contents as PRECIOUS METALS/FAMILY TRESURES.<br><br>\nIn respect to the above arrangement, you are urgently requested to travel to Amsterdam-Holand to enable you claim the consignment and deposit into your bank account, in any case, a safe and conducive arrangement has been put in place for this purpose. Therefore,by this opportunity you are required to inform me of your schedule and readiness to travel to Amsterdam-Holand to also enable me arange for my cousin to meet with you in there  for more guldance. <br><br>\nI must assure and reassure you that the diplomat who is conveying these money boxes to  you in Holand is not just an \"ordinary diplomat\" but a very senior and top United Nations official who happens to be one of the UN representatives.Infact I had to go through chains of procedures and hardships in order to secure the services .<br><br>\nThis diplomat enjoys total UN immunity in any company's and bank representative, Regions, in the world. So it is therefore unneccessary for you to dwel or even think that the diplomat would be unable to accomplish his mission regarding this our transaction. I have his word on this and I assure you that the consignments will be routing to you in Holand safely in your favour and  again,I have to implore you to use your good office to arrange and consolidate my effort by making your schedules without entertaining any fears on how to recieve the diplomat in  Holand upon his arrival.<br><br>\nOncemore,You will be receiving the funds through the Diplomatic attachee to United Nation Diplomatic Agent  who is a high powered diplomat and has the immunity to airlift the consignment of such while it's contained the total sum of  US$12.7Million which will routing to Standard Trust  Clearing House In Amsterdam-Holand. All your information will be giving to the diplomat to enable him communicate with you on his arrival for onward clearance by you as the beneficairy to the consignment. <br><br> As soon as the diplomat arrive he will call you so that you  so you can present yourself as the only legal representative to the consignment, So my own duty is to make all necessary arrangements and present you as the bonafide owner of the funds via legal means which had already reflected properly in the papers from the high Court issued in your favour, then your own duty is to Guide the diplomat until the consignment get to you safely. And this we must do and make sure that no mistake is made throughout the entire transaction.<br><br>\nAs you can see, every thing about this transaction is almost coming to an end, all i needed from you now is your altmost cooperation as to ensure safe clearance of the consignment by the Diplomat who will deliver the consignment as ealier been told. <br><br> Be guided Accordingly that the Diplomat does not know the contents of the boxes, it was decleared to them as Family assets and to deliver as routed to the owner which is you,Never by mistake let him know that the contents are money, this is for security reasons.<br><br>\nKindly respond to this message as soon as possible and give the phone number where you can be reached. <br><br> Thanks<br><br>\nBarr George William<br>\nSummercamp Advocates<br>\nMonrovia-Liberia<br>\nPhone:23-480-33024879.\n( bank approval.doc attached)\n</td></tr>\n\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "", "author_role": "bait", "body": "My dear George, \n\nThank you for your note.\nIt is rather rambling, however.

First of all, to show\nhow sincere i am, i had to send you my ID, but when\ni requested yours you did not respond.Then when it\ngot to the real business proper, i did everything\nthat was necessary, even spending my whole money\nwithout bothering you to assist me financially just\nto prove my committment and sincerity.When it was\ntime to meet in Amsterdam to conclude modalities i\nspelt it out that my delegate would be working with\nyou and you accepted, and to my amazement after\nhaving spent money to prosecute his travel\narrangement and sent him to Holand to meet with you,\nand what did i hear after almost one week of his\narrival you later claimed you were in Amsterdam but\nrefused him seeing you, which you later said you did\nnot want work with him any longer and requested me\nto come personaly, which i also agreed but that you\nhave to assist me with Transport fare since i have\nno other money at the moment, and what did i get at\nthe end, your last email.
