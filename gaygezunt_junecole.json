I am a US citizen but Hugarian by birth, 48 years Old. I reside here at 1650 Cowles Street Fairbanks, Alaska I am one of those that executed a contract in Africa years ago and they refused to pay me, I spent over US$75,000 trying to get my payment all to no avail.Things became so tight for me and my family. So I decided to travel down to Nigeria with all my contract documents.There in Nigeria it was hell having being swindled before I was afraid of everybody not until I got information that the payments were been made from a bank in Abidjan. They directed me to meet one Barrister Charles Anyanwu who is based in Abidjan the journey was too stressful because I had to embark on another journey.He is a consultant for Bridge Bank and the Uk Treasury that have intervened in these delayed payments especially the interest the fund yielded over this period. The interesting part is that I did not spend any money as we agreed on paying him his service charge only when I received my payment which I have long redeemed except for little amounts for Affidavit and afterwards Notarization just because I was scared of leaving the embassy because of the negative reports I heard about Africa. He said that those contacting us through emails are fake. Then he took me to the paying bank , Bridge Bank and I was paid.I am now the happiest woman on this earth because I have received my contract funds of $2.5 Million USD. Moreover, Barrister Charles Anyanwu Esq, showed me the full information of those that have not received their payment,and I saw your name among one of the beneficiaries.I think you should contact him immediately with the below details,he can be of help.
