One you have\nscanned in the LARGE and CLEAR photograph, please send it back to\nme as an attachment.\nOne both the photograph and the agreement form have been received\nand approved your donation payment will be paid out IMMEDIATELY\nin a manner of your choosing.\nMr. Tope, of course I fully understand that the picture request\nseems very strange, but as I have explained before, it is this very\nstrangeness that will ensure to the Donation Committee that the\nimage is not a forgery.\nIf you are in agreement with the churches' request, please get\nback to me ASAP and I will forward you the agreement form. You will\nalso be given a Donation Agreement reference number which you must\nquote of all future correspondence.\nGod bless you and I look forward to hearing from you soon.\nFather Bateyoo Reelgud.\nNB: I have attached a photograph of one of our newest smaller churches.\nHopefully soon we may be able to build churches in your beautiful\ncountry.\n\n\n", "comments": ["", "[The beautiful church of Fish & Bread!]"], "subject": "", "date": "19 DEC 2003"}, {"from_name": "Tope", "raw": "            <p align=\"left\"><i>From: Tope<br>\n              Subject: to GOD be the glory!!<br>\n              Date: Sun, 21 DEC 2003 18:40:20 +0100</i></p>\n            <p align=\"left\"><i>Good day sir,<br>\n              I really appreciate the way and manner you have been handling this \n              matter.May<br>\n              God bless you and the entire members of your humble church.<br>\n              Actually ,i have gone over the mails over and over again and i find \n              nothing<br>\n              too strange abt the whole arrangement after all it's a genuine cause!but<br>\n              permit me to really say that as you have said that the pose is rather \n              an<br>\n              unusual one but i know am dealing with pple of God here.after all \n              all what<br>\n              have said is the whole truth and i hope at the end of the day i \n              wont regret<br>\n              calling on pple like you for help.<br>\n              So am looking forward for the agreement certificate and i will proceed<br>\n              on taking the pics ASAP.<br>\n              Say me well to the whole committee members.<br>\n              cheers.<br>\n              TOPE</i></p>\n            <p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p>\n", "author_role": "scam", "to_name": "", "body": "Good day sir,\nI really appreciate the way and manner you have been handling this\nmatter.May\nGod bless you and the entire members of your humble church.\nActually ,i have gone over the mails over and over again and i find\nnothing\ntoo strange abt the whole arrangement after all it's a genuine cause!but\npermit me to really say that as you have said that the pose is rather\nan\nunusual one but i know am dealing with pple of God here.after all\nall what\nhave said is the whole truth and i hope at the end of the day i\nwont regret\ncalling on pple like you for help.\nSo am looking forward for the agreement certificate and i will proceed\non taking the pics ASAP.\nSay me well to the whole committee members.\ncheers.\nTOPE\n\n\n", "comments": [], "subject": "to GOD be the glory!!", "date": "Sun, 21 DEC 2003 18:40:20 +0100"}, {"from_name": "Father Bateyoo Reelgud", "raw": "            <p align=\"left\"><b>From: Father Bateyoo Reelgud<br>\n              Date: 21 DEC 2003</b></p>\n            <p align=\"left\">Dear Tope,</p>\n            <p>Blessing to you, and I hope you are well?</p>\n            <p>I am pleased that you are happy with the arrangements.
