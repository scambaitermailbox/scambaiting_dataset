He is from Belgium, and has\nworked and lived here in Ghana for more than ten years as a gold prospector\nand consultant for Dantax Gold Company, a subsidiary of Gold Coast Mining\nCompany( the Government Ministry in charge of Gold Mining in Ghana).  Mr\nBrandon was wealthy and I enjoyed a cordial client /attorney relationship with\nhim while he was alive.  He was my client for eight years of the ten years he\nlived in Ghana. He died under mysterious circumstances in a car crash on the\n23rd of April, 2002. The police did a shoddy investigation and were unable to\nunravel the mystery sorrounding his death, even though suspicion was rife that\nhe may have had a face off with the gold mafia king pins who may have\neliminated him to protect their own interest.\n\nRichard made a deposit of USD 9.5million in a Finance House here in Ghana\nbefore his death.  The deposit was made in the year 2000, and he died two\nyears later with his entire family of three(his wife, a son and a daughter)in\nan auto crash en route to Accra. He died intestate. I have made every effort\nto locate anyone who could be even remotely connected to him or his family,\nfor the past three years, but I was not successful. That was why I asked if\nyou were in any way connected to the family, in which case, I would have had\nno option that to fulfil my obligation of ensuring that the estate and funds\nof my late client were duly executed on his behalf or in favour of any member\nof his family or his proxy, chosen by him. In his absence, and having left no\nwill, I have the obligation of doing justice to his estate. But I am\nincapacitated because I cannot locate the relatives or any body who knows\nthem.\n\n\nRecently, the Finance House where he made his deposit has issued me a notice,\nas his personal attorney,that they  will, within a forth night,proceed to\ndeclare  the account unserviceable as an unclaimed bill if I am unable\nto produce the next of kin to the deceased, and subsequently confiscate the\ndeposit and hand it over to the government. That is why I needed your help,\nand that was why I contacted you. This transaction is risk free and you  will\nnot be breaching any laws, I assure you.\n\nI know that this may go against your moral ethics.

They almost succeeded when I had that hot exchange with the\nManager.  But I had to make things aright by claiming that I was under\ninstruction from my client(you) to find out why the delay.  The explanation\nthey gave was that they needed to ensure that..\"all reasonable doubts were\neliminated, to avert misappropriation...'  This is the official position and\nit is justifiable.  I did not contest it, because it would have looked\nsuspicious if I had to put undue pressure on them to approve payment when they\nclaimed they were still conducting their verification.   But now, they have\nconcluded.  I was reliably informed by a contact person in the Finance House\nthat tehy have concluded and will definitely contact you by friday, if they\nhave not already done so.  As a matter of fact, my contact person claimed that\nhe was sure a mail had been dispatched to you. Let us assume that there was a\nnetwork problem, and that they will definitely reach you tomorrow.\n<br><br>\nIt is not my place to say what the requirements are.  The Finance House  will\nbe the ones to say exactly what their requirements are.  By tomorrow, all\nthese things will be made clear.  Please be a little more patient.  We have\npractically come to end of the transaction.<br><br>\n\nI guess wat you claimed I said was this line in my mail of Friday, October\n14th,\"...  We have to finish with one before you go into another project.\nThis one is almost over.  And I am very anxious to get it over with and get\nbusy with other things.  By this statement, what I meant was that we have\nalmost concluded the transaction, and that what is left is for us to get the\nmoney released to us, that's all.<br><br>\n\nI urge you to please make effort and reschedule your flight. I am strongly\npersuaded that the meeting will likely be in the middle of the week,most\nprobably on wednesdayor thursday.<br><br>\n\nHope to see you then.<br><br>\n\nBest regards.<br>\n\nFred.\n\n\n</span>\n<br><br>\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "", "author_role": "bait", "body": "Fred,\n\n\n\ninstead of spending hours on writing elaborate emails to me, I'd prefer more\nconcrete action from you.

You don;t catch a shadow,\ndo you?    Fred Asuquo does not exist.  It was all a ruse.  the phone lines\nare just P.A.G mobile phones from private telephone providers.  The government\nhas no control over their activities.  Besides, you do not pick them up with\ngenuine particulars.  Save your breath then, and savour the fun so far.\n\n<br><br>\n\nI lost some money, and had some real excitement.  Frankly, if I had read your\nmail  on thursday before your phantom trip, I would have known you made a jest\nof yourself.  The pink shorts, pink shirt and  the blank white placard was a\ncomplete give away.  That was why I did not do it.  I went to the Labardi, and\nto the Cathedral.  But I did not go to NOvotel, even though you pointed in\nthat direction.  I knew you were flying a kite.  It is a psychological thing,\nyou know, and I am not so completely bereft of intelligence.\n\n<br><br>\n\nI confess that even when it became obvious that you were faking all these,\nsome of my colleagues in the scam refused to read between the lines.  Blinded\nby the greed for the $30,000, nothing else mattered, even though if it had\nbeen a trap, I would have been caught red handed.  But then, it would have\nended up bad for you too.  You were coming in (if you had actually come in) as\nan accomplice, an accessory after the fact of crime.  You would be as guilty\nas the scammer himself.  Tell your fellow whites that the reparation due to\nAfrica for 300 years of rape and violation will be paid in full either by hook\nor by crook, from this generation or the next.  And unless the white man\nconfesses and takes a positive proactive action for restitution, he can never\nbe free.  This is the idealogy of the scammers.  Would you want to know how\nEurope and America underdeveloped Africa?  Would you want to know more about\nthe perenial debt burden of the third world countries and the refusal of the\nso called Industrialised Nations to accept debt repayments intead of insisting\non debt servicing?  What do you call this?  A scam of international scale or\nis it international politricks?\n\n<br><br>\n\nJack,  I did not ask for your friendship to scam you.  I saw a challenge in\nthe astutue way you habdled your part of the fun.  I was impressed.  I do not\nget easily caught off guard.  But I confess yoou really had me.  I like that\nintelligence in a man.\n<br><br>\nWe may meet on a different and possibly equal format some day.  Its a small\nworld after all.  Even though your name is not Jack.  Whose picture was it you\naffixed on that your fake id card?\n<br><br>\nI do not expect that this will be our last mails. iT IT RATHER THE END OF THE\nBEGINNING, AND THE BIRTH OF A NEW PHASE.\n<br><br>\nYours,\n<br><br>\nFred.\n\n\n</span>\n<br><br>\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "", "author_role": "bait", "body": "Fred,\n\n\n\nI did not think I would send you another email after my last one, but I\nchanged my mind.

There was more verbiage about the digital divide. 'Fred Barrister', at any rate, doesn't seem to have a digital divide problem, apart from his failure to divide Jack Breda from his cash.]</span><br><br>\n\n</td>\n\n<td width=15%></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<br>\n<center>\n<p>\n<font size=-1>\n<a href=\"http://www.scamorama.com\"><b>scamorama main street</b></a> \n* \n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1932857389?ie=UTF8&tag=wwwscamoramco-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1932857389\" target=\"blank\"><b>get booked</b></a><img src=\"http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wwwscamoramco-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1932857389\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\" /> \n* \n", "comments": []}]}
