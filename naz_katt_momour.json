It has\na heavily built body covered with coarse hair, a heavy snout, and a distinct\ncollar of light-colored hair around the neck. These animals are common in the\nsouthern desert regions of Arizona, New Mexico and Texas, where they frequent\nthe shrubby areas and canyons.

It has been a very hectic time for us, what with the death of Aunt Tillie and all.\n\nIf I may, I will bring you up to date on the events that lead up to today. After Aunt Tillie died, her spinster sister Tabitha went into a catastrophic depression, and that lasted nearly two weeks. We couldn't get Aunt Tabby to eat, and all she did was sit in front of the fireplace and stare at nothing. It was scary.\n\nThen Aunt Tabby started behaving very oddly. She crawled up into the elm tree in our front yard, and it took the fire department men to get her down! They said she was going crazy, but we just assumed that she is overcome with grief.\n\nFortunately, her physician, Dr. V. E. Ternary, prescribed an anti-psychotic medication for her, and now she is back to her seat in front of the fireplace. We had to promise her that we would have her fur coat cleaned. Why she wanted us to do that, we are at a loss to figure out, as she usually just takes care of that herself. Now, today, Aunt Tabby is back to her normal self, and we can assume our regular activities.\n\nI am very happy for that, as I know you have been awaiting our payment of the fees involved with this transaction.\n\nBarring any unforseen circumstance, you should receive the payment tomorrow. Please, will you send the recipient's information again? I seem to have misplaced it. Thanks.\n\nSincerely, Morris D.

KATT</span><br><br><span class=\"ast\">\nDear Mrs. Bridget Horn,<br><br>\n\nI know it has been a few weeks since our last correspondence, and for that I apologize. It has been a very hectic time for us, what with the death of Aunt Tillie and all.<br><br>\n\nIf I may, I will bring you up to date on the events that lead up to today. After Aunt Tillie died, her spinster sister Tabitha went into a catastrophic depression, and that lasted nearly two weeks. We couldn't get Aunt Tabby to eat, and all she did was sit in front of the fireplace and stare at nothing. It was scary.\n<br><br>\nThen Aunt Tabby started behaving very oddly. She crawled up into the elm tree in our front yard, and it took the fire department men to get her down! They said she was going crazy, but we just assumed that she is overcome with grief.<br><br>\n\nFortunately, her physician, Dr. V. E. Ternary, prescribed an anti-psychotic medication for her, and now she is back to her seat in front of the fireplace. We had to promise her that we would have her fur coat cleaned. Why she wanted us to do that, we are at a loss to figure out, as she usually just takes care of that herself. Now, today, Aunt Tabby is back to her normal self, and we can assume our regular activities.<br><br>\n\nI am very happy for that, as I know you have been awaiting our payment of the fees involved with this transaction.<br><br>\n\nBarring any unforseen circumstance, you should receive the payment tomorrow.

Katt, who, along with his brothers, Felix, Garfield, and Sylvester, were innocently involved in an attempted robbery of their bank.\n\nAs much information as can be gathered from the police reports, they were just about to make a substantial withdrawal. They were being served by the teller, miss Minerva T. Oucan, when several men entered the bank and announced their intent to rob the bank and all the people in the bank.\n\nWhile his brothers distracted the robbers' attention, Mr. Morris tried to be the hero, and dis-arm one of the bad men, and was shot right in his Gluteous Maximus, and has lingered near death for almost 2 weeks, until he finally died in agony early yesterday morning. In going through Morris' mail accounts, we found your name and decided to contact you as soon as possible to inform you this tragic news.\n\nFuneral arrangements are being made by his brothers, who are all in agreement that it was a good thing that the youngest brother, Fritz, did not witness the event, as It may have destroyed him, and turned him back to his former life.\n\nTheir Uncle Tom was at home with Fritz, and was also spared this ordeal.\n\nI know you will send your heartfelt condolences to the Katt family, but please do not send any flowers. A small donation to the charity of your choice will be a fitting memorial to my old, and treasured friend, Morris Desmond Katt.\n\nSincerely, and in deep mourning,\n\nHugh Jardon", "raw": "<hr>\n\n<span class=\"nazc\">[Morris seems to have used up one of his lives.

Katt, who, along with his brothers, Felix, Garfield, and Sylvester, were innocently involved in an attempted robbery of their bank.\n<br /><br />\nAs much information as can be gathered from the police reports, they were just about to make a substantial withdrawal. They were being served by the teller, miss Minerva T. Oucan, when several men entered the bank and announced their intent to rob the bank and all the people in the bank.\n<br /><br />\nWhile his brothers distracted the robbers' attention, Mr. Morris tried to be the hero, and dis-arm one of the bad men, and was shot right in his Gluteous Maximus, and has lingered near death for almost 2 weeks, until he finally died in agony early yesterday morning.
