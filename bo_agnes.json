I am very concerned for you even though I am happy for your sake that you have met this wonderful woman Agnes, but please make sure that they are who they say they are.\n\nYour friend\nBohika\n\n----- Forwarded Message ----\nSent: Wednesday, March 12, 2008 \nSubject: From Mrs Josephine U.Sibigam . \n\nFrom Mrs Josephine U.Sibigam . \n\nI do hope my letter will not embarrass you since there was no previousCorrespondence held with you. MY Getting your address is the handwork of thealmighty God. Since then, I have been very much hopeful that you will assist usirrespective of the fact that the present world is full of dishonesty anddistrust. \n\nFirstly,I will wish to introduce myself. I am Mrs Josephine Sibigam,from Sierra Leone; I am the wife of,CPL  SIBIGAM UWANDI.My husband was the Leader of the Revolutionary United\nFront until he was dethroned and arrested early last year by PresidentTEJAN KABBAH which later handed him over to the United\nNations war crime tribunal were he later died in detention.As a resultof this position in the government,my son (SIBIGAM  UWANDI) and ltried and later succeeded in securing some of his assets,which include mansionsand physical cash. This is to avoid The present government from confiscatinghis entire property. \n\nWe left Sierra Leone withthe total amount US$26.5 Million (Twenty Six Million Five Hundred ThousandUnited States Dollars) only, which we Brought to Belguim and depositedsame with SAFE TRUST BANK IN BELGUIM ,as valuable documents belonging to ourforeign affiliate. After depositing the money, my family and I were asked toleave BELGUIM and was made public on BELGUIM  National Headlines, wewere left with no option than to seek refuge in my homeland in NEAR BYCOUNTRY HERE IN Benin repubic of Cotonou . Thesecurity company bank later asked me,to come and claim the consignmentimmediately to avoid the money being confiscated. \n\nI arrived here a couple of days ago and through a good contact l applied for arefugee status as an asylum seeker, which is still pending in Foreign AffairsDepartment.The problem now is that because of our status,we cannot risk movingthe money without help hence I am looking for a trustworthy partner, who canhelp me move this money out of Belgium .Inthat case, I want to know if you can help me transfer the fund into youraccount in your country or elsewhere since time is not on my side. \n\nAs a widow of three children I need your urgent attention to this matter..It istrue that we have neither met nor known each other before, but the informationI gathered of your credibility makes me believe that with trust and honesty wewill achieve a huge success in about a week.
