Im taking my bra of. Help me with it. (see\nmy picture...) Do you like my butt? Its tight baby...\nI dream that you touch it..\n You have to give me a good picture now, if you wanna\nsee more. Do you wanna see my boobs? They are nice, I\nbet you'll like them, baby.\nI understand that you don't want to show your most\nsecret part, its ok. I might show you my sweetest\nthing, if I feel for it. We'll see...\nBut, if you wanna see my boobs and more, then you\ngotta send me a really good pic first.\nSo this is what I want from you first:\nSend me a picture of you wearing underwear, and a\nbra. Thats right. If I take of my bra, I want you to\nwear one! Can you do that for me baby? It would really\nturn me on to know that a man is so passionate for me\nthat he do anything for me. You said that my will is\nyour command, so do it for me!\nI'm gettin really horny and hot, and I dream about you.\n\nIf I get a pic of my man wearing a bra, then I'll send\nyou whatever you like, phone, some money so you can\ncall me, you name it.
