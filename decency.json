We aid them by presenting them with a scholarship\npayment ranging from $25,000 to $150,000 which again is entirely\ndependent on their potential, but the minimum payment we award any\nartist willing to supply work for us is $25,000.\n\nSuccessful applicants are rewarded so highly because we are always\nseeking new artists to produce work for us and we would expect your\nfuture work to be made available to us exclusively and of course\nyou would be rewarded accordingly for working with us.\n\nCurrently we are only seeking people with comic artist skills, so\nif you have some experience in this field then we would welcome\nyour application.\n\n\n1. Before we could make any kind of monetary payment to any artist\nwe would of course require proof of their abilities. We do not ask\nartists to send in prepared samples of their work because of course\nthere is no way for our foundation to know if the artwork is indeed\nthe artists own work, therefore we would require artists to provide\na brand new sample for us to evaluate their abilities.\n\n2.

The artist would then\nbe required to duplicate BY HAND of course, the pages of this comic\nto the best of their abilities. Once you have completed the work\nit is to be sent to us for evaluation and then a donation amount\nwould be awarded according to your skill or potential. Our donation\npayments range from between a minimum of $25,000 up to $150,000.\n\n\n3.

You must try to reproduce as much detail as you are able to. \n              The more detail that you are able to reproduce then the more easily \n              we can gauge the quality of your work and therefore the higher your \n              final payment will be.<br>\n              <br>\n              5. Once you have completed the sample pages you must then arrange \n              to have the samples scammer AT VERY HIGH QUALITY and sent to us \n              by email attachment.<br>\n              <br>\n              6. Once we have received your work it will then be evaluated by \n              our four board members and your payment amount will be awarded WITHIN \n              24 HOURS.<br>\n              <br>\n              7. On receipt of a satisfactory piece of artwork my four board members \n              will then gauge the quality and therefore the size of the donation/scholarship \n              amount to send to you. The payment is sent by whatever means suits \n              you best and is made within 24 hours of receiving your work.<br>\n              <br>\n              You may use whatever size of paper that you feel comfortable with. \n              Using large sheets of paper will be easier for you to capture all \n              the detail, just ensure you are able to scan it correctly when you \n              have completed the work.

You can remember the term on which we\nagreed to work on initially.\n\nIn the beginning, expressly told you that I am not a paint but a\nwriter; hence I offered to get comic painters for you from Nigeria\nand you agreed to pay me a stipulated agency fee.\nOn that note, I set out in search of people with such talent\nwhich took me to a lot of places. At a time I found some of them\nand communicated it to you where we agreed you would send samples\nto me, by email attachment, to be copied by hand by the painters.\nThe work was quickly concluded, but I had a mishap which destroyed\nthem before they could get to you and I duly told you. In that regard\nI had to go back to the painter so he could reproduce another sample\nto be sent to you and he demanded I must pay him to the last penny.\nI tried to explain to him but he wouldn`t listen. He even erroneously\nthought that I had collected some money from you. I took him to\nmy house to show him what the storm did but he felt I had sent them\nto you before it happened.
