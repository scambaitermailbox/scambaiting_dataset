Should he wish to make translation of my missive he will discover it is only my native German translation of the song \"Mairzy Doats\" and be in much confusion. Now to you, sir.\n\nYou have with much deliberateness ignored my requests for additional informations regarding Mr Peters, and with much laxative failed to read the Barrister's message to me. This transaction is very VERY BIG! We are not stealing pennines from grandmothers pocket book, but $16.8M dollars US! Do you think they will be such fools as to say, \"Oh, Mr 96 Years of Age Man, you say you are the nephew of this very young man so it must be so, so here, have his money.\" Not bloody likely! I have gone so far with you in what you and I must know is criminal activities because the reward of such undertakings is large, but so is the riskyness of it all. We, if caught, will not be sent to our homes with stern warnings - we will be sent to a jail where we will become the boy toy pets of tattooed gangstas! Mark my words.\n\nIf you wish to my continuance, do the following and do them quickly:\n1.) Send me the informations asked for about Mr Richard. How old was his age upon death? Where he live? and the like.\n2.) Send me the informations the Barrister Prince has wanted, the like being Letter of Affidavid from the Court, the Death Certificate, and the Legality Certificate.\n3.) Other covering informations.\n\nIf I see such in my computer mail soon, I will know we are going to be partners - and RICH PARTNERS at that.
