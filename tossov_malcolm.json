Since I need a foreigner in this \ntransaction, I must give you my trust this transaction is no joke and such opportunity \ncomes once in a life time.

My intention \nis to have the package sent to you from within Europe via a Special Security Firm who \nhandles the prompt delivery of confidential valuables goods for the military, based in \nEurope; The German diplomat is to arrive Europe with the Package any time soon. I will \ninform you when the package is dropped off and brief you of any new developments.

This might appear as an illegal thing to do but I tell you what? No \ncompensation can make up for the risks we have taken with our lives in this hell hole. The \nabove figure was given to me as my share and to conceal this kind of money became a \nproblem for me, so with the help of a German contact working with the UN here(his office \nenjoys some immunity)I was able to get the package out to a safe location entirely out of \ntrouble spot.

I have been out on the field for the paste hours without returning to camp. There have been a lot of battle out here in the last 2days and a lot of lives where lost, I write you this letter in sorrow because I lost my closest friend in the battle field and since then I have not been myself, I need you to always pray for the souls and lives out here because people are dieing everyday, most of all pray that I will make it out of here because this is the prayer I pray for myself everyday.\n</p>\n \n<p>\nI want to thank you for your prayers and assurance given me to proceed further with this transaction, and also for this chance you have offered a man like myself in need, I want to promise you that you will never regret this,  I said in my earlier mail, the total funds $10,570,000 (Ten million Five Hundred and Seventy Thousand US dollars) were sealed in a Medium size metallic trunkcase properly insured under the UN diplomatic core, which means its protected and in tacked, I will send you the combination codes to open the trunk to see the funds immediately the package gets to you.\n</p>\n \n<p>\nGOOD NEWS: I have been informed that the package is already in The United Kingdom and it is in the possession of an Attorney there as per my instructions to the Diplomat. Now that the package has reached Europe I will need you to call the attorney immediately and request that you speak directly with Barr. David Rosenblatt, he is the attorney in charge, you are to speak freely with him but note that the barrister do not know the exact content of the trunk because of security reasons. The attorney is meant to believe that the package Contains highly classified Diamond and Gold and other Christmas/new-year presents so it must be handled with care and security. Please I need you to understand that bringing them in the picture too gives it more backup legally. I want you to contact him proclaiming yourself as the owner/beneficiary of the package and that the package is made to be your Christmas present.
