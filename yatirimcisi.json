But please kindly keep to your promise as the \n money in been paid to you , remember that agreement is \n agreement. \n 2)The reason why Alhaji pays cash at the point of \n delivery is because of the condition my Director has \n given to him, and also in as much as he need it by all \n cost he has no choice but to abide by the procedure my \n Director give to him. And his cows is dying for \n breeding and footh and mouth sickness. And some other \n little farmers are depending on him to source the \n medicine. This is the reason why he pays at point \n delivery.
