In a lame  mans language  this  simply means a reconfirmation from the source   of  transfer. This will raise red flag and is not in our favor. For me to be able to bring in this funds to your   account  without any red flag I will be transferring  the  funds via  secured routes. What I am doing is not a normal  wire or  swift  transfer but a special type of transfer. I want you to  be  rest assured that there will be no questions  from anywhere as the funds will enter your account as  clean  and cleared  funds.\n\n\nI will go over  my explanations again  to you so  you understand what  I require from you and want  you to   understand the limitations I am talking about. You must trust  me if we can make this happen. Like I said I  am  head transfer of my bank and my bank code of  ethics and  privileges limits my ability to do this  without your  help.\n\n\nA junior officer in   my bank tried to move funds  for his own benefit last year  and he  was caught. The reason  is that he violated our bank code of ethics and privileges  by setting up account in  his sisters name some where else  and activated  this account by sending a small initial  deposit before he began to transfer the  funds  which run into  millions of dollars. He was attached to  the remittance  department of the branch he worked  with.\n\n\nI am  head  transfer and have access  to key systems and codes. If you can guarantee helping  me to ensure I do not violate my code  of  ethics and privileges then be rest assured that we can  make this  work and  100% risk free.\n\n\nThe truth of the   matter  is if I must make direct transfer to your account this has to be  done through safe and secured  route.  This is to ensure that we  do not  violate the US foreign  Assistance Act of 1961, as amended ( the \"FAA,\" 22 U.S.C  2291), which defines a major  money laundering country  by statue as one whose  financial institutions engage  in currency  transactions involving significant amount  of  proceeds  from international narcotics trafficking.    481(e)(7).\n\n\nThis also implies to high volume of  funds   transfer all over the world to also check the  activities of   terrorist.

This  codes require  activation fee which the agent must receive before he  will release the codes to me and have  them  activated as  he requires a card value for the  activation of the   codes.\n\n\nMy banks code of ethics and  privileges  which  guilds us,makes it mandatory for me as   head transfer of my bank  to get approval from my Bank before I make any personal transfer  internationally and this  will  require me to explain to a  committee set up for  this and Considering the nature of this transaction it is  not wise  for me to get an approval to have  money transferred to the  agent or anywhere else this will draw   attention to me and I  am not ready to take  this risk  this transaction is very  sensitive. I occupy a sensitive  position in my bank and I  have to be very  careful. Its not just  transferring the  funds  but ensuring that we are safe after the transfer and   this I can assure you if you can understand me. Be  rest assured that this will be done legally. If you can be   able  to pay the agent for the codes and the  activation then  I  can get the codes and will be able  to transfer the  funds.  Let me know if you can pay  the agent.\n\n\nBe rest  assured  you will not  loose in this my transaction. I am a family man and will not do anything to bring shame and disgrace  to  my  family.
