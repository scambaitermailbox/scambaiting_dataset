So please do not be embarrassed.\n\nI sincerely write to seek your co-operation and trusts to enable me carry out an urgent business opportunity in my department. I am Mr. Jackson Paul, an account manager to Mr. E Wayne. Who died along with his family in the Asia Earth Quake Disaster (TSUNAMI DISASTER)http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2004/tsunami.disaster/ All of his Family lost there lives in the Disaster. Since then I have made several inquiries to his Country embassy to locate any of my client's extended Relatives, this has proved unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to contact the Nigeria Chambers and Commence were I got your contact.\n\nMy client was a successful and accomplished family man, who works with Shell Company here in Africa, He was sent to Asia (Sri Lanka) for a Special Assignment for his Company (Shell) were he died. He left in his domiciliary account a 40% of individual private deposit with our Bank, which I have with me the Investment Deposit Certificate an important\ndocument worth Six Million United Stats Dollars (US$6 Million). Until date I still manage this Deposit will like to know you personally and then I will give every consent to the Bank here as knowing you and state in Court here declaring you as the next of kin to my late client.\n\nI am contacting you to assist in repatriating the money left behind by my late client. The Bank will pay this money to you as an inheritance. After the sudden death of my client, and for the reason that there as has not been a next of kin to my late client, the bank has decided to forfeit the money and declare it as an abandoned property as there is no next of kin who should inherit his funds.\n\nThe board of directors of his bank adopted a resolution and I was mandated to provide his next of kin for the payment of this money within 28 working days or forfeit the money to thebank as an abandoned property. The bankers had planned to invoke the abandoned property decree of 1996 to confiscate the funds after the expiration of the period given to me.I have reasoned very professionally and I feel it will be legally proper to present you as the next of kin of my deceased client, so that you can be paid the funds left in his bank account. I therefore seek your consent to present you as the Next of Kin to my Deceased client so that the proceeds of this Bank Account valued at  Six Million United Stats Dollars (US$6 M) can be paid to you.\n\nThe need for a foreigner as next of kin in this project is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Nigerian will not perfectly fit in as his next of kin or heir. I have agreed that a reasonable percentage of the Fund would be giving to you as foreign partner, thereafter I will meet you in your country for disbursement.\n\nPlease understand that my approach to you is based only on my positive reasoning and on the belief that you will not disappoint or betray me at last. The amount is fairly huge and we have agreed that on completion of the deal, you will be highly compensated for your assistance. An attorney will be contracted to help us revalidated and notarize  all the necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim you may make as soon as I hear from you with your full consent to present you to the Bank as the next of kin to my late client and after both of us reach an agreement.\n\nAll I require is your honest cooperation to enable us seeing this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Please consider my official positions, reputation and integrity, especially, the opportunities in the business itself, it is very necessary that all due care be taken so that we do not miss the opportunity due to carelessness.\n\nYou are therefore expected and advised to display high degree of maturity, responsibility and understanding in handling this information.
