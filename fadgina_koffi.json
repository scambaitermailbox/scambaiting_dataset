KOFFI  JEAN; I am a representative with the United Nations Department of International Monitory Unit. I am writing in respect of a discovery of unclaimed fund in tune of US$10M (Ten Million  United States Dollars) belonging to a late foreigner. This fund is deposited in a Bank in Rep of Togo (name will be disclosed upon the receipt of your positive response).  The Late Customer's name is Mr. Morris Thompson. He is an American by Citizen who perished in a plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31 2000; there with him are his wife and only daughter. You shall read more about the crash on visiting this site which I got during my investigation;  \n \nSTUDY CAREFULLY THIS WEBSITE TO CLEAR YOURSELF OF ANY DOUBTS:   \n \nSince the demise of this gentleman, I personally have watched with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds of US$10.M (Ten Million United States Dollars). This money has been in a Bank custody for a very long time. On this note, I decided to seek for whom his name shall be used as the Next of Kin as no one has come up to be the next of kin. And the Banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than Ten Years, because the money will be recalled to the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund after this period.  \n \nIn view of this I got your contact when making a research on a foreigner I will use in this great opportunity.  For your assistant I will give you 30%of the total amount then 10% have been mapped out to be donated to the motherless babies home, while the remaining 60% will be for me and my partners.\n   \nI will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch free and that you should not entertain any fear as all modalities for the smooth and hitch-free transfer of this fund has been finalized, this transaction will be completed within five banking days of receiving your positive response.  \n \nTHE ONLY APPROVED CLAIMING PROCEDURE:-  \n \nTo ensure a successful consummation of the business, there is need for me to follow the normal and legal procedure of doing things so that no country laws will be contradicted. This is 100% risk free as we have no intention to do anything that will go contrary to the laws of any Nations.  \n \nIn this regard, I suggest, while I run the cost of procuring the entire legal document from the judiciary departments Togo, required to transfer this inheritance in your names as the beneficiary? and in my names of the guarantor? You also on your own side will ONLY be required to open an Account Escrow with the Bank in Togo where this fund has been lodged for the past ten years, so that an internal transfer within the same Bank will be made to your new account.  And with this process no monitory security Agents will be alerted over the transfer of such huge amount of money and that will give us a hitch free transfer at the shortest time. After this, the Bank will send you an ATM card of International operations to your address through any good courier service so that you may have access in withdrawing this fund from your country.
