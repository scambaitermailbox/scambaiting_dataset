He was ! banking with my bank and I m his\naccounting officer. However, since the death of Mr. Toshio,\nI have been trying to contact  any of his relative in the\ncity of Osaka, his home country Japan through his address\nwith me, to let his people know about his money  in our\nbank but I did not receive any response. I later remembered\n that Mr. Toshio came to my country out of shame he was\nreceiving  from his country because he was impotent. This\nsecret he revealed  to me when he was  alive because I\npestered him to introduce his  children to me. Now I have\ndecided to link anybody to stand as Mr.  Toshio next of kin\nin order to claim the money he deposited here  as Fixed\nSolid Investment since nobody knew about it. Government of\nmy country will pay it to Federal Reserve if I should\ndeclare to them about this fund. Note that there is no risk\ninvolved in this transaction, as I will give you all\ninformation you may need about Mr. Toshio and his banking\nrelationship with my branch to enable you stand as his next\nof kin  to receive this money in you'r account. This\ntransaction will go  through normal banking process only\nthat you have to stand firm  as the next of kin to Mr.\nToshio just to claim this money. I will  direct you on how\nto apply for the claims of this money. Please  if you are\ninterested and capable to carry out this deal with me,\ncontact me through my email address  or . I will require the following\ninformation from you for procession of the fund in your\nfavour.\n\n1. Your private phone and fax number\n2. Your account information where this fund will be paid\ninto.\n3. Your home address. I personally need your home address\nbecause I do not know you too well before now only that I\ndecided to work with you on trust believing God that you\nwill not cheat on me.!
