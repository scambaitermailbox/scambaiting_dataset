It is however agreed,as the account owner in this deal to allow you 30% of the entire sum as compensation, 65% will be held on trust for us while 5% will be usedto defray any incidental charges and cost during the course of the transaction. \nThis transaction will be successfully concluded within 14 days if you accord us your unalloyed and due cooperation.You should provide the followings; \nYOUR COMPANY`S NAME WITH COMPLETE ADDRESS, \nTELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS.(if available) \nTHE NAME OF YOUR BANK,ITS ADDRESS WITH TEL,FAX AND YOUR \nACCOUNT NUMBER, THE COMPLETE MAILING ADRRESS OF THE BENEFICIARY WITH TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS. \nUpon the receipt of this informations,i will forward them to the organisation for ratification and subsequent payment. \nAs with the case of all organised (sensitive)and conspired DEALS,we solicit for your unreserved confidentiality and utmost secret in this business. We hope to retire peacefully and leave a honourable business life afterwards.There are no risks involved. \nYou can reach me through my private phone 00228-8522437 for more details. \nThanks while i look forward to your positive reply.Please reply back to me on my private email id if you are interested johnsondr.williams59@yahoo.com.hk \nWith regards. \nDR.
