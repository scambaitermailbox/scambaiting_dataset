and I must tell you that I inadvertantly let out the secret of our business arangement.I know that you wanted it to remain a secret and I had every intention to but Mr. Ripemov was able to guess the true nature of the questions I was asking and upon further questioning he was able to prise from me that I was involved in a transfer of foreign monies.On retrospect I think that we should be glad that I let our secret slip.He expressed some doubts about the legitmacy of this whole affair but I assured him that I have been in contact with you for a month now and I am a pretty good judge of character so he agreed to take the case.\n\nHe explained to me that foreign transfers are far more complex than my banker has led me to believe.If anyone can bring this transaction to completion, it is Mr. Dewey Ripemov.Mr. Ripemov is a master of legal manoeuvre and I think we will need his expertise. \n\nHe is a tenacious ould Kazakh sod who came to Ireland with nothing but the clothes on his back and a fierce will to succeed.Don't ever tell him that I told you this but he learned the \"art of deal\" by running contraband on the blackmarket in the USSR while keeping one step ahead of the KGB.He escaped to the west by walking more than 200 kilometres barefoot through the snows of Uzbekistan to reach freedom in Afghanistan.I'm telling you this so that you will know that he is a tough man who knows how to see things through to the end and most importantly he knows how to keep his mouth shut.We are lucky to have him working for us.\n\nMr. Ripemov has agreed to look over our case and contact us with his assesment of what needs to be done here in Ireland.I will rely on Mr. Casmir to handle things in Africa.\n\nKeep well,\n\nyour Seamus", "raw": "<hr><h3><font color=\"green\">Seamus O'Paddy [30]</font></h3>\n\n\n7 Sep 2003<br><br>\n\nDear Mrs. Butuma,<br><br>\n\nI was talking to my lawyer several days ago about my annual tax liability and I must tell you that I inadvertantly let out the secret of our business arangement.I know that you wanted it to remain a secret and I had every intention to but Mr. Ripemov was able to guess the true nature of the questions I was asking and upon further questioning he was able to prise from me that I was involved in a transfer of foreign monies.On retrospect I think that we should be glad that I let our secret slip.He expressed some doubts about the legitmacy of this whole affair but I assured him that I have been in contact with you for a month now and I am a pretty good judge of character so he agreed to take the case.<br><br>\n\nHe explained to me that foreign transfers are far more complex than my banker has led me to believe.If anyone can bring this transaction to completion, it is Mr. Dewey Ripemov.Mr. Ripemov is a master of legal manoeuvre and I think we will need his expertise. <br><br>\n\nHe is a tenacious ould Kazakh sod who came to Ireland with nothing but the clothes on his back and a fierce will to succeed.Don't ever tell him that I told you this but he learned the \"art of deal\" by running contraband on the blackmarket in the USSR while keeping one step ahead of the KGB.He escaped to the west by walking more than 200 kilometres barefoot through the snows of Uzbekistan to reach freedom in Afghanistan.I'm telling you this so that you will know that he is a tough man who knows how to see things through to the end and most importantly he knows how to keep his mouth shut.We are lucky to have him working for us.<br><br>\n\nMr. Ripemov has agreed to look over our case and contact us
