ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS TO PROVIDE OR SET UP A TRUSTED ACCOUNT WHERE THE MONEY WILL BE PAID INTO IN YOUR COUNTRY.I WILL THEN USE THE ACCOUNT INFORMATION TO LODGE LETTERS OF CLAIM TO THE SECURITY COMPANY IN EUROPE .To start with, I am Dr mrs Maryam Abacha, the wife of the former president of Nigeria, General Sanni Abacha who died on 8th June, 1998 from heart failure. Infact this money in my possession, was my husband's share in a debt buy back contract deal between my husband and a Russian company in our country's multi-billion dollar Ajaokuta Steel project. The Russian company returned my husband's share of US$45 million after his death and it was lodged in a security company by me being his beneficiary. After his death, the present Government out of wickedness want to suffer me and my children for something we dont know anything about. The origin of the matter is that, when my husband was in power, as the head of State and Commander in chief of Nigeria Armed Forces, the present head of State, General Olusegun Obasanjo, planned coup against the Government of my husband and the coup was failed and he was jailed with other officers.Now that he is out of prison, he contested election and won as the democractic elected president, since then, he refused to see anything good in the hands of my family as if it was me and my children that jailed him. he has subjected my family to intimidations. My children were banned from travelling outside of Nigeria while I was subjected to house arrest since 1999 he came to power till date. Our properties both in Nigeria and abroad was seized, our bank accounts in Nigeria and abroad frozen.The Government said that if they allow me to move freely, I will use my connection with world leaders to work against his government.Poor me, a widow, I don't know how I can fight a whole federal Government of a country instead of looking for a way to take care of my children to me, every thing is witch hunting because I don't see anything to justify my arrest.But as God may have it for my family, As my late husband next of kin I have now seized the opportunity to lodge the $45 million U.S Dollars cash in a vault in one of the security and finance companies in Netherlands, Europe and this money is what I want you to assist me and my family invest in any lucrative business of your choice in your country or any other country.

Infact,I am very pleased to write you this mail which is in connection to the transfer of $45 million dollars Mrs abacha intends to transfer into your care for safekeeping and for investment purpose. Firstly, I must first crave your indulgence to supply me all the necessary personal information about yourself and this information you are to give me will be used by me to open a non-residence bank account in your name by the ABN AMRO here in Netherlands as already arranged by the bank manager,so that when the clearing of the consignment from the security company here in Netherlands is approved,the money will be lodged into this non-residence account in your name for further transfer into any account of your choice in your country. Infact the transfer of the money will be made through Swift bank transfer and that will only take 2 working days before the money is completely wired or transfered into your chosen account in your country. To start with,based on the documents given to me by Dr Mrs Maryam Abacha concerning this money deposited at the security company, I must inform you that the money has been initially deposited in the name of her eldest son Musa Abacha at the security company here Netherlands and the efforts of Nigeria government is to confiscate any assets or freeze any account or seize any money found belonging to Dr Mrs Maryam Abacha and her family both within Nigeria and abroad. However,in order to deal with this matter with whole care, as her attorney,I must first change the ownership of the money into your name by procuring all the necessary documents such as the certificate of legal right of ownership from the Federal ministry of Finance in Netherlands which must be issued in your name and i will as well change the certificate of deposit initially issued in the name of Mr Musa abacha (the eldest son of Mrs abacha) at the security company into your name for the sum of $45 million dollars here in Netherlands using my power of attorney and this will cost the sum euro 1,200 together with the procesing cost, please bear that in mind. To procure this Certificate of legal rigt of claim in your name from the federal ministry of finance in netherlands and thereby convert the ownership of the sum $45 million dollars into your name however,I have informed Dr mrs Maryam Abacha to write a letter of confirmation that during her husband president Sanni Abacha's regime,contract worth of $350 million dollars was awarded to your company and your own commission in the contract is $45 million dollars which he president Sanni Abacha personally collect on your behalf for further transfer into your foreign account and this couple with his untimely death as a result of heart failure. While the money was still at home,Dr mrs Maryam Abacha as his next of kin,took the responsibility of depositing the money in her son's name with the Devcon security company in netherlands whereas the original owner of the money is Mr which is you. A copy of the certificate of legal right of ownership issued in your name will be forwarded to the security company to inform them that you are the original owner of the sum $45 million dollars deposited with them in the name of Mr musa abacha. The security company having received a copy of this certificate of legal right of ownership, will issue a new certificate of deposit bearing your name with them and these two certificates will now be used by me to clear the consignment from the security company in your name together with other documents given to me by Mrs Abacha and then lodge the money into the Non-residence account which I will open here in your name by the ABN AMRO BANK HERE IN NETHERLANDS for further transfer.In a retrospect,I would like you to supply me the below information by filling the claim processing form which I have attached to this mail.Sir,for me to open the non-residence bank account in your name here in netherlands,you are required to send to me a copy of your driving lic<br>\nence,or national identity card or international passports for this is the requirement for opening a non-residence bank account onbehalf of any foreign nationals or persons who cannot be in netherlands in person to officially open this account.The information you are to supply me is as follows:Full Name:Address: Company Name: Country of birth: Account number: Sir, the arrangement with the bank manager is that once the consignment is cleared from the security company and deposited into the non-residence account which I will be opening in your name here in netherlands,the next thing is to further the transfer into your required account in your country and the bank manager told me that it will only take 2 working days to wire or transfer the money into your chosen account in your country, therefore as a matter of urgency this matter demands, I would like you to fill the claim processing form which i have attached to this mail, so that you can provide me with your personal information,the account information and the necessary wiring instruction concerning the transfer so that the transfer can commence immediately.\nDr Mrs maryam abacha today during her visiting hours in Nigeria, wrote me today and request of me to ask you concerning the type of investment you will help her secure with her own share,and I quite believe that she would be very happy to hear about the investments which you think is lucrative to secure on her behalf and she prayed that God will continue to uphold and bless you more in everything you are and will be doing concerning this transaction.
