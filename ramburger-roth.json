I am willing to pay an additional deposit, just to show my good will that Mr. Bumpers will not be a worry, I will put down an additional $2,000.00 USD as a gesture of assurance that there will be no damage to the house (this is above the normal rate for domestic chimp deposits, which are normally $1,000.00-$1,500.00 USD). \nAll I ask is that at least a fair portion be refunded, assuming there is no chimp related damage, at the end of my leasing term.\n\n\nI would hope that this is an acceptable offer- again, I will provide you with the deposit amount you are asking for, and I will also pay you $2,000.00 USD additional as a special case pet deposit that you may keep until the end of my living term on the premises. Also, remember I have a special coverage Chimpanzee Insurance, so there is no real risk to you. \n\n\nI have a few more questions-\n\n\n1- Is there an appropriate location where I can park my moped scooter at the property?\n\n\n2- Would it be acceptable that I install temporary monkey-proof locks on the primary doors? (I can remove them when I move out)\n\n\n3- Can we negotiate possible terms, such as additional payment, for an additional tenant? (so there will be 2 of us living there, plus Mr. Bumpers)\n\n\n4- Can you tell me about the potential nearby clowns? If you do not know, that is okay, but I am asking just in case you do.\n\n\nThank you again Mr. Gary d, hopefully this will still work with my unique situation.
