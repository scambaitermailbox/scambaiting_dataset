I have urgent and very confidential business \n              proposition for you. On June 6, 2000, an American Oil consultant/contractor \n              with the nigeria Mining Corporation, Mr. michael creek made a numbered \n              time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$20,200,000.00 \n              (Twenty Million two hundred thousand Dollars) in my branch. Upon \n              maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address \n              but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally \n              we discovered from his contract employers, the nigeria Mining Corporation \n              that Mr. michael creek died from an automobile accident. On further \n              investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and \n              all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. </i></p>\n            <p><i><br>\n              I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. michael \n              creek did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, \n              including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$20,200,000.00 \n              is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over \n              with the principal sum at the end of each year.

Consequently, \n              my proposal is that I will like you to stand in as the next of kin \n              to Mr. michael creek so that the fruits of this old man's labor \n              will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. \n              This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full \n              names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary \n              documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next \n              of kin. </i></p>\n            <p><i>We shall employ the service of two Attorneys for drafting and \n              notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and \n              letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. \n              A bank account in any part of the world which you will provide will \n              then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next \n              of kin.
