Though,\nwe have not met before, and i consider this as an unusual way of presenting a\nbusiness cooperation, i pray that you forgive me because i do not have any\nother option rather than soliciting your cooperation through this means. I got\nyour contact while i was searching the net for a reputable company or\nindividual with whom i can transact this business with. I was a protocol\nofficer to Ange Felix Patasse, the former president of Central African\nRepublic, who is deposed and is now on exile in the republic of Togo. In the\nevent of the rebellion that removed Patasse from power, i made away with two\nwell-sealed boxes each containing the sum of USD 25,000,000 from a secret vault\nin the presidential villa.With the help of my German friend, who was a\ndiplomatic courrier to the President, he assisted me in transporting these\nboxes from central african republic to Cotonou, in the republic of Benin\nthrough a diplomatic channel. For security reasons, he assisted me in lodging\nthese boxes with a security company in Cotonou and registerd the boxes in his\nname as ontaining FAMILY CONFIDENTIAL DOCUMENTS AND FILES. He gave me the\nsecret code and a copy of the DEED OF LODGE. Unfortunately for me while i was\nstill in detention for political reasons, my German friend died 3 months ago of\nCardiac complications. This may have been as a result of numerous matrimonial\nproblems. Now that i have been released from detention, i have gone to the\nsecurity company to raise claims to these boxes but the security company has\nrefused to honour my request, saying that the boxes were not registered in my\nname but the name of my late German friend. Now, the security company has\nrequested that they can only release these boxes to any of my late friends\nfamily members or foreign associates on provision of necessary proofs such as\nthe SECRET CODE, PHOTOCOPY OF THE DEED OF LODGE AND DEATH CERTIFICATE of my\nlate friend. All these informations and documents i already have in my custody.\nBut i need a foreigner like you who can assist me in raising this claim by\nputting in an application as my late friends associate. I cannot treat this\nbusiness with my late friends ex- wife for two obvious reasons:\n1) if i treat this business with her, i may loose all my money to her because\nshe may not understand that this money belongs to me and not her former\nhusband.\n2)i never knew her and never met her, but i know she was a major factor to my\nlate friends death because he always mentioned how she was cheating on him\ndespite all he had done for her.My late friend has a 9 month old baby which he\nhad from a relationship with a Central African woman, he so much loved his\ndaughter, now she is left without a father and adequate care. I have mapped out\n10% of this money to be paid into a child's welfare account for her,\nimmediately the money is released.\nBefore my friend died,i had plans with him to invest this money into real\nestate business in Germany as a joint venture with him, that is 70% for me and\n30% for him. I want you to assist me in raising this claims so that this money\nwill be released for both of us. We can invest this money in your country in a\njoint partnership, 65% for me, 25% for you while 10% goes to Anita, my late\nfriends daughter's welfare account. If we have a deal, contact me immediately\nso that we can talk.This whole secret is shared only between me and my late\nfriend, now you are the third person. No time to waste.
