I am Mrs. Monica Martin.\n\nI got your contact through a carrier diplomat whom I consulted in my search for a reasonable/reliable individual who could assist my son (Mark Martin) in transferring a reasonable sum of money abroad into a company or personal account for investment purposes. \n\nDuring the current war crisis against the farmers in Zimbabwe, which was supported by Press Robert Mugabe because of his envy and greediness to claim all the white and some black owned farms for his party members and his followers, he ordered all white farmers and few black farmers to surrender all their farms (lands) to his party members and followers. My husband (Mr. Thomas Martin of a blessed memory) owned one of the best cattle farms in our country by then and because he did not Support Robert Mugabe ideas, Militants encamped on his cattle ranch farm in Mvurwi region, 150 kilometers (94 miles) northeast of Harare. This act was to buttress what the president saidWe are no longer going to ask for the land, but we are going to take it without negotiating,\" Mugabe ordered his supporters to invaded my husband's farm in Mvurwi region, and burnt everything in the farm in as much as killing my beloved husband and made away with a lot of items in my husband's farm. (19 Feb 2001,around 3.30 PM) \n\nMy husband was a former lawmaker in the white-dominated parliament of Rhodesia, as Zimbabwe was known before independence, and served, as an independent lawmaker along with 20 whites as 20 seats was reserved for whites for the first seven years of independence.He was an outspoken critic of President Robert Mugabe's ruling party. Mugabe has described the farm occupation as \"a justified protest against unfair land Ownership by whites and few blacks\". \n\nBefore my husband's death he deposited the sum of US$10 M, (TEN Million United States Dollars) in a Security Company in South Africa under cover as gem stones, this was for fear of President Mugabe and his government as he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe.\n\nThis money is for the opening of the new 265 Acres of land in Shiselweni Village near Umbuluzi River in Swaziland, which my husband was negotiating to buy with the help of the Swaziland Monarch King Mswati iii. In my husband's will, he stated,\"I did this for you (Mark) because as a father I noticed that there is no future for my family in Zimbabwe.I deposited the sum of US$ 10 M. with a security company in South Africa Go to South Africa and Seek for the assistance of a foreign partner who will help in transferring the fund out of South Africa for investment purposesPlease do not disappoint me, God bless you\". \n\nAfter my husband's funeral, my son (Mark) left for South Africa where my husband deposited the money in the Security Company, he cannot open an account in South Africa because of his refugee status according to SECTION 22 OF THE REFUGEE ACT NO 13 OF 1998. \n\nIn view of this, I decided to seek assistance for my son in transferring the fund abroad. On acceptance of this proposal, we have two options for you, (A) firstly you can choose to have a certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction, in this case we are prepared to offer you 25% of the total fund. (B) Or you can go into partnership with my son for a proper profitable investment of the money in your country.\n\nWhichever the option you want, feel free to notify my son or me. We have also mapped out 5%, to repay expenses that may be incurred by both parties in the course of the transaction while the remaining 70% are for my son's investment. From the words of my husband you will discover that the continuos existence of this family depends on this money, this is why we need an assurance from you that this fund will be safe when transferred to your country. \n\nLastly, I am assuring you that this transaction is free of risk but I must not fail to inform you that it requires absolute confidentiality for security purposes.\n\nContact my son (Mark)\nTelephone 27 -83 396 7709\nEmail: family_mark2003@yahoo.co.uk\n\nFor more details of the transaction and also stop us from further negotiations.\n\nSincere Regards,\nMrs. Monica Martin.", "raw": "<tr>\n<td width=15%></td>\n<td width=70%>   \n\n\n\n<font face=\"Georgia,Arial,Verdana\"><b><i><font color=\"red\">Mrs Monica Martin</font></i></b><br><br>\n\n  \n\nTue, 29 Mar 2005\t<br>\nX-Originating-IP:\t [165.146.32.32]\t<br>\nFrom:\t \"MRS MONICA MARTIN\" <br>\nTo:\t monica_martin01@hotmail.co.uk\t\t<br>\nSubject:\t Urgents Bussiness Assistance:\t<br>\nDate:\t Tue, 29 Mar 2005<br><br>\n\t\n    \nDear; sir/madam,<br><br>\n\nThis letter may come to you as a surprise, but be assured it is in good faith from a family in dare need of help.
