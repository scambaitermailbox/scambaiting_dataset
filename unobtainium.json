You are my brother, right? \nI protect you like a brother.  Well I'd lay my head on \nthe railroad tracks, and wait for the Double E for my \nbrother.  But the train don't come by here no more, \npoor poor pitiful me.  I don't want you to be poor, \npoor pitiful, either.  Since we are brothers, I would \nnot hurt you are a mother, either.  She's been through \nfar too much for shenanigans like that. \n\nI don't try to be a clawn, it just comes across that \nway.  Sharp-edged business language, I guess.  Get to \nthe point, I always say--don't go beating up \nbushes--tell people what you think.  I don't criticize \nyour transaction--I criticize lawyers!  Bad lawyers, \nno donuts.  Phony e-mail, phony phone--I think phony \nlawyer.  And he took money from you!  He should be \ndisbarred, or rebarred, or whatever Swaziland does to \nphony lawyers. \n\nI signed your document, my pilot is waiting, tight in \nthe seat, and I'm ready to go to Amsterdam.  I'm sorry \nI offended you, but please let us still be brothers so \nyou can get you are a mother's money. \n\nPlease write back so I know you are still wishing for \nme to be your brother. \n\n\nRobert Weir", "I fear that it was a bit too over the top for Baldwin, \n'cause I haven't heard anything from him in a couple days.  \nBut then, I've been in jail in the Azores, so what do I know.  \nThis is all that's happened since I sent you the last. \n\n\n\nBrother Baldwin, \n\nDAMN!  DAMN-DAMN! \n\nThere I was, happily coasting over the Atlantic on the \nway to Amsterdam when BOOOM!  My pilot gets on the \nintercom and tells me we have to make an emergency \nlanding in the Azores!  Can you believe it?  Now I've \ngot Azores all over my body!  Passport checks, customs \nchecks, body cavity checks--THEY THINK I'M AN \nINTERNATIONAL TERRORIST OR DRUG DEALER!  They want to \nknow why I'm carrying so much cash, particularly in \nthe portion of my body in which I was carrying it. \nThey've put me in the local hoosegow, and I smuggled \nthis note to my pilot to send to you from my computer \non the plane.  I hope it gets to you.  Am I getting to \nyou yet?  Are you getting it? \n\nPilot says the 7th Fetzer valve was sticking, and \nhe'll need some ball bearings before he can fix the \nplane.  Meanwhile, I'm going to have to bribe these \nAzorian azzholes to let me go!  Good thing I brought \nextra cash!  My pilot is getting the extra cash now, I \nhope, and with luck, I'll be free in a few hours. \nThen I'll say I'm free--I am free, and freedom tastes \nof reality, you know.  Can't wait.  Time wasting. \nHate being wasted. \n\nTICK, TOCK, TICK, TOCK \n\nI'll update you when I can.  Sorry to delay, but \nunavoidable. \n\nBrothers forever! \nRobert Weir", "Brother Baldwin, \n\nGot myself out of Azorian hell--had to pay dearly \nabout $100,000 US, but I'm out.  One more body cavity \nsearch for good measure.  Took the rest of my cash \nstashed there.  DAMN.  Okay, where were we?  The way \nwe were.  I'm getting back on the plane to Amsterdam. \nAmsterDAM, maybe.  7th Fetzer valve is fixed.  Good \npilot--hard to find him, glad to have him, hate to \nlose him. \n\nWhat next?  Gimme van den Berg's contact info again. \nDamn Azorians took my laptop, too, so I don't have \nthat information with me.  Had to use this damn \ncomputer at the hotel. \n\nThis better be a smooth deal with van den Berg or I'm \ngonna start looking for heads to roll.  Not mine, \neither, if you know what I mean.  I've missed almost \nthe whole market week, and that's wasted money.

It gives me \na message stating that it has been disconnected.  This \ncauses me concern in that I have shown good faith in \nproviding you a working telephone and fax number, \nwhich you have used to contact me.  This is my only \nphone number, so if you get the message machine, it is \nbecause I am unavailable.  I would appreciate your \ngiving me a telephone number that functions so we may \nspeak together.  Barring that, I do not see any \nparticular need for voice-to-voice contact, as much of \nmy business is done with persons I've neither met nor \nspoken to.  This is the wonder of the electronic age \nin which we live.  As such, I have re-scanned the \nguaranty letter, and it should be attached in the \nformat you requested.  As to the passport, it is in a \nsafe-deposit box at my bank in Miami, and I do not \nhave access to it at the moment.  I typically leave \nMarathon Key only once per month to do my banking, and \nI just went to the bank four days ago. \n\nIn any case, I would be somewhat hesitant to send you \na photocopy of my passport in this day of terrorist \nplots against Americans.  I would not want my passport \nduplicated for ill use abroad.  I am sure you can \nunderstand my hesitance in this regard.  In the \nalternative, I have attempted to scan in my driver's \nlicense, which should be sufficient for your purposes \nto verify my identity. \n\nIn any event, your message appeared to carry with it \nsome urgency, and I am puzzled as to why you insist on \ndelaying the progress of our arrangement.  Believe me, \nwith the amount of money I have, and my investment \nbackground, I have literally hundreds of investment \nopportunities presented to me each week, and those \nthat go quickly with a minimum of difficulty gain my \nuppermost attention.  Your situation is falling by the \nwayside because you appear to be insisting on matters \nthat I do not believe are necessary to complete the \ninvestment. \n\nPlease forward whatever documentation is necessary to \ncomplete this arrangement so I may contact my pilot to \nready the jet to travel to Amsterdam.  Every day I \nkeep him on standby waiting to fly costs me money, and \nI am not willing to wait much longer for you to send \nme the necessary information.

It gives me \na message stating that it has been disconnected.  This \ncauses me concern in that I have shown good faith in \nproviding you a working telephone and fax number, \nwhich you have used to contact me.  This is my only \nphone number, so if you get the message machine, it is \nbecause I am unavailable.  I would appreciate your \ngiving me a telephone number that functions so we may \nspeak together.  Barring that, I do not see any \nparticular need for voice-to-voice contact, as much of \nmy business is done with persons I've neither met nor \nspoken to.  This is the wonder of the electronic age \nin which we live.  As such, I have re-scanned the \nguaranty letter, and it should be attached in the \nformat you requested.  As to the passport, it is in a \nsafe-deposit box at my bank in Miami, and I do not \nhave access to it at the moment.  I typically leave \nMarathon Key only once per month to do my banking, and \nI just went to the bank four days ago. \n\nIn any case, I would be somewhat hesitant to send you \na photocopy of my passport in this day of terrorist \nplots against Americans.  I would not want my passport \nduplicated for ill use abroad.  I am sure you can \nunderstand my hesitance in this regard.  In the \nalternative, I have attempted to scan in my driver's \nlicense, which should be sufficient for your purposes \nto verify my identity. \n\nIn any event, your message appeared to carry with it \nsome urgency, and I am puzzled as to why you insist on \ndelaying the progress of our arrangement.  Believe me, \nwith the amount of money I have, and my investment \nbackground, I have literally hundreds of investment \nopportunities presented to me each week, and those \nthat go quickly with a minimum of difficulty gain my \nuppermost attention.  Your situation is falling by the \nwayside because you appear to be insisting on matters \nthat I do not believe are necessary to complete the \ninvestment. \n\nPlease forward whatever documentation is necessary to \ncomplete this arrangement so I may contact my pilot to \nready the jet to travel to Amsterdam.  Every day I \nkeep him on standby waiting to fly costs me money, and \nI am not willing to wait much longer for you to send \nme the necessary information.
