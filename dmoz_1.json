I have urgent and very\nconfidential business proposition for you. On November 1999, an American\noil consultant /contractor with the Cote D'Ivoire Ministry of Aviation ,\nMr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) deposited for twelve calendar\nmonths, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty-five Million Dollars) in my\nbranch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding\naddress but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we\ndiscovered from his contract employers, Cote d'Ivoire Ministry of Aviation\nthat Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident. On further\ninvestigation, I found out that he did not leave a WILL and all attempts\nto trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further\ninvestigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any next\nof kin in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork.\n\nThis sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in the Bank and the interest\nis being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No\none will come forward to claim it. According to the Ivoirian Law, at the\nexpiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of\nthe Cote d'Ivoire Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.\nConsequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand\nin as the next of kin to Mr. Barry Kelly so that the fruits of this old\nman's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt officials.\n\nThis is simple, I will like you to provide me immediately with your full\nnames and address so that an attorney will prepare the necessary documents\nand affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall\nemploy the services of an attorney for drafting and notarisation of the\nWILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter of\nprobate/administration in your favour for the transfer. A bank account in\nany part of the world, which you will provide, will then facilitate the\ntransfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money\nwill be paid into your bank account for us to share in the ratio of 80%\nfor me and 20% for you.\n\nThere is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be\ndone by the attorney and my position in this Bank guarantees the\nsuccessful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please\nreply immediately via this my private email address. Upon your response, I\nshall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will\nhelp you understand. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest\nassured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us\nbecause I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.\n\nAwaiting your urgent reply via email or phone no +225 07774012.\n\nThanks and God bless you\n\nBest Regards\n\nMR DOMINIC GOMA.", "comments": [], "raw": "<html>\n<head>\n<title>What's the bloody point ??</title>\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"600\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Expires\" content=\"Tue, 1 Jan 2002 00:00:00 GMT\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Pragma\" content=\"no-cache\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Cache-Control\" content=\"no-cache\">\n<link href=\"wtbp.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\">\n</head>\n\n<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\">\n<center class=\"bigor\">\n  <table width=\"100%\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n    <tr> \n      <td class=\"bigor\"><center>\n          Whats the Bloody Point?</center></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr> \n      <td><center>\n          <span class=\"introor\">Scam 1</span><br>\n          <span class=\"intro\"> Email 1</span></center></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr> \n      <td height=\"27\"> <img src=\"pics/spacer.gif\" width=\"5\" height=\"30\" border=\"0\" align=\"absmiddle\"> \n                <span class='nav'>&lt; previous</span> \n                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n        <a href='mails.php?scamno=1&mailno=2' class='nav'>next &gt;</a>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href=\"scam.php?scamno=1\" class=\"nav\">index</a> \n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr> \n      <td><img src=\"pics/spacer.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"8\" border=\"0\"></td>\n    </tr>\n  </table>\n</center>\n<table width=\"100%\" height=\"14\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n  <tr>\n    <td height=\"6\"><img src=\"pics/spacer.gif\" width=\"10\" height=\"6\"></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"100%\" height=\"1\" background=\"pics/bl.gif\"><img src=\"pics/spacer.gif\" width=\"10\" height=\"1\"></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td height=\"6\"><img src=\"pics/spacer.gif\" width=\"10\" height=\"6\"></td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n<span class=\"introbold\">Opening email</span> \n<P class=\"ed\">This one was passed to me<br />\nIt was apparently sent in 1980 (Dominic needs a new BIOS battery)<br />\nI'd skip this if I were you it's all rather boring.<br />\nJust skip straight to my reply...</P>\n \n<P class=\"txtred\"><span class=\"txtor\">From:</span> Dominic Goma [mailto:domgoma@libero.it]<br>\n  <span class=\"txtor\">To:</span> -<br>\n  <span class=\"txtor\">Date:</span> Friday, January 04, 1980 1:58 AM<br>\n  <span class=\"txtor\">Subject:</span> Re: Urgent Assistance, (Great Financial Reward).<br>\n  <br>\n  FROM THE DESK OF MR DOMINIC GOMA.<br />\nAUDITING AND ACCOUNTS DEPT.<br />\nFOREIGN REMITTANCE DIVISION<br />\nBANK OF AFRICA (BOA)<br />\nABIDJAN-COTE D'IVOIRE.<br />\n<br />\nSir,<br />\n<br />\nI am Mr Dominic Goma, Manager of Auditing and Accounts Department of the<br />\nForeign Remittance Division, Bank Of Africa.
