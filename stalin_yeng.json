Now do you see what I'm\ntalking about? I have absolutely no idea what causes such vitriol; I\nhave never been anything but polite to an extreme with him. I suggest to\nyou that the man is mentally deficient, most likely due to inbreeding.\nI've seen these symptoms before in persons of his temperament and in\nmost cases the parents were brother and sister. I certainly don't feel\nthat he has the mental capacity to handle our project.\n<br><br>\nI fear that this idiot may intentionally try to delay or hinder our\npursuit of the U-boat commander's estate. Is there nothing that can be\ndone?\n<br><br>\nHui Tebya,<br>\nJoe\n<br><br>\n<i>I guess Lee and Yeng have taken about all the abuse they're going to\ntake. Well, if they can't handle the MiGs, they shouldn't fly in MiG\nAlley. - J.V.S.</i>\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n", "comments": []}]}
