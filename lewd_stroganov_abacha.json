We've had an encounter between one of those damned sasquatch and a hotel guest and the guest came off the worst. I'm sure there's going to be legal action against the hotel if we don't get out and hunt these things down.<br><br>\n\nI leave this morning with two of the groundskeepers to find these varmints and get rid of them once and for all. I don't want a delay in the transaction so I have forwarded your and Zainab's address to a close friend and associate of mine. I have asked him to work with you to bring this deal to a successful conclusion.<br><br>\n\nA little background - his name is Mikhail Stroganov and he runs a very successful publishing company. He is probably the wealthiest person I know and he knows how to get things done quickly. I did not have time to bring him completely up to speed on where we are but I did receive an email from him agreeing to assist. I will reimburse him myself so you dodn't have to be concerned about that. From the small part that I explained to him he is very enthusiastic about this. I mailed him my power of attorney, which he should have in the next day or two, and complete authorization to act in my behalf. He will be contacting you shortly.<br><br>\n\nWell, I'm off, wish me luck. If I get back anywhere near the hotel I'll check in with you.

I somehow have the feeling that you are not being told everything about what has been going on with this transaction and may even have intentionally been given false information.\n\nThe consignment was not taken to London because of the imposter that Mikhail was able to eliminate.

What I did refuse was to let that bloodsucker charge us for a lot of unnecessary crap.
