Already, our\n\norders for the upcoming quarter are up fifteen percent, and it's still\nwell before lunch here in\n\nNevada.

This has NOT been properly addressed, at least not\nin detail.\n\n\n\n2) I asked what expenses I should expect to incur or otherwise eftsoons\nas a part of this\n\nbusiness.  We are none of us children, sir.  You came to me, out of the\nblue; please understand\n\nthat I know you sought me ought because I am known as a wealthy man who\nhas, in the past,\n\nengaged in some unusual business practices.  You know this, therefore,\nyou want something. \n\nNothing wrong with that.  I understand completely.  But I do expect to\nbe told what it is you\n\nwant.  That is how gentlemen do business.

Fine -- but do me the courtesy of\nspelling it all out.\n\n\n\n3) I asked what risks I would entail as a part of this finical\nenterprise.  Your brother\n\nadmitted there were risks, but did not elaborate.  I require this\nelaboration.  For instance, a\n\nsimple \"If anyone in authority should learn of this fimbria, we shall\ncertainly be required to\n\nfile an International Extortionate Preamble Action with the World Court\nFinancial Extrasystole\n\nCommittee in the Hague\" would suffice.

I explained that my spiritual advisor uses this\ninformation to complete her\n\ndivinations.

While I am no\nmystic myself, I do know\n\nthat to determine the prevailing humor of your bodily fluxes, one must\nperform the following\n\nsimple ritual:\n\n\n\n1a) Take a bowl, large enough for your hand to fit into, and fill it\nwith water.

As you speak, count the drops of\nwater that fall from\n\nyour hand and LAND BACK IN THE BOWL.\n\n\n\n4a) Tell me this number.  Madame Zorria will use it to figure out the\nrest.\n\n \n\nMr. Savimbi, I must have responses to all the questions above before we\ncan proceed.  I cannot\n\nstress that strongly enough.
