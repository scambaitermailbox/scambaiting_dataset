I got it from British immigration. Those guys really know how to make the bureaucratic process a never ending form filling fun. My goal here is to waste this guy's time and efforts, and hopefully incur some costs to him, such as printing and scanning. A bonus: I put my credit card number on it, of course not my real one, since I will be paying his $750 \"membership\" to the Republican Party as a courtesy. So now the guy thinks he got a free credit card number, which he may try to sell or use to purchase some goodies. I certainly climbed up his \"suckerama\" scale with this one. If he sends an incomplete or botched form, I will play ping pong and request the proper modifications.

The advanced analysis program I used state that these two IDs are fake with a probability of 99.6%. I do not understand your behavior. Why use fake IDs when you have 17 million dollars to be transferred and undermine the whole plan I have set up for you and your sister? I am losing trust in you. Again, please send me an appropriate identification. As I told you before, I only need your identification.\n\n$500 is very expensive for a simple malaria treatment. I checked with my doctor and here the same treatment would cost about $75 and you get a complete proctologic examination with it. A brain transplant, which is a very complex surgery, would cost $500. I did not know that medical bills in West Africa could be so expensive, especially when people are so poor. Please send me a copy of a receipt for the medical treatment and I will see what I can do.\n\nAll this is causing delays in our transfer plans. I have already opened a bank account in Vanuatu and was able to set aside $25,000 to cover the transfer fees (if required). The Republican Party eagerly awaits one of its new contributors. I have also received the documentation for Annah's school. It is a nice Catholic school run by a French lady. It is called : \"Sainte Marie de mon Calice de Tabernacle\".\n\nSincerely,\n\nJack",

This guy has a lot of imagination and quite good in the art of lying. I have a lot of work to do and could drag this for a while, but time to stop this one very abruptly. Sorry \"Eddy\". Hope you will be very annoyed to learn that this charade has been for nothing. Makes me wonder if 10,000 people tried to scam bait at least one mugu, we could seriously undermine these Lads business. They would freak out, not knowing who is a legitimate bait and who is trying to waste their time.]\n\n",

I receive these pathetic 419 emails everyday from Nigeria, South Africa, Benin, Cote d'Ivoire, etc. They are all variations of the same lie. I hope I have wasted a little bit of your time and hopefully some of your money. There are hundreds of people like me (some are much better than I am) wasting the time of thieves like you. You will never know who is real until you have wasted a lot of your time finding out and doing really stupid things in the process. So which email in your mailboxes is coming from someone real?\n\nBy the way, my name is not Jack, I do not live in New York and I certainly do not work for the Republican Party. Do you know what this political party is all about? I certainly had a lot of fun enrolling you in the Republican Party and hopefully I will have our little correspondence posted in a web site for the whole world to see and laugh at a mugu who wanted to be a Republican.\n\nIf you constantly cheat and lie, how can you make your life right? I do think you realize how much damage this 419 business is doing to the reputation of your country and fellow honest citizens.\n\nDo not worry, I am quite sure we will correspond again for another scam of yours, but this time I will impersonate somebody else and waste your time and money. Maybe we are already corresponding elsewhere as I \"handle\" 5 to 10 mugus at once. Also, the PDF files I sent you contained Trojan viruses which enabled me to have hidden access to your computer.
