But you knew that. Superfinerose.com offers a contact number in Seoul, South Korea. Good pick. Who's gonna call Seoul?<br /><br />\nThere are several variations on this scam. In the first, you are sent a bogus check, and are asked to send the 'hiring' party a money order for most of that amount. By the time you find out the check is bogus, you've lost your money. In a second variation, the check is real but the payee altered. You are being used to cash a stolen check. In a third variation, the check is real and you are being used to launder money. In another, the scammers use stolen credit card information to order goods which they then have delivered to you. You ship the goods onward to the scammers.]</p>\n\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "", "author_role": "bait", "body": "Dear Andy Taylor:\n \n Comes to you this day Roland Deschain, Of Gilead that was.
