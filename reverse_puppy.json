I need you to lift up his tail and tell me what shade of blue his underlying excretion gland is. If it is a light blue colour then he will be perfect. If it is Dark Blue then sadly I shall not be able to teach him the violin, so will have to fall back on the Bass guitar.<br /><br />\n \nMany thanks<br />\nJoseph.<br /><br />\n \nP.S. Please get back to me as soon as possible as I want to get the payment to you for Billy.<br />\n\n\n<p class=\"comment\">[Crufts is an international dog show and competition]</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "2007-08-23 00:00", "subject": "", "author_role": "scam", "body": "Hello joseph\n                    Thanks for the information,i went to the Airlines office early today and Billy was doing fine,i have checked Billys tail and is underlying excretion gland is Light blue,so billy would be ready to learn how to play the violin,here is a brief explaination on how to make the payment via western union money transfer:\njust walk to any Western union outlet near you and send the payment directly to the payment  section information of  B.A :\nReceivers Name:Oluwaseun Bamigbose\nLocation:London,UnitedKingdom\nAfter you have made the payment a receipt would be issued out to you,So you would send me the following infomation which would be written on the receipt,in other for me to forward it to the Airline immediately:\n1)MTCN 10 digit number\n2)Senders Name\n3)Secret question and answer\n4)total amount sent.\n\nBelow are some Western union Outlet near you:\n\nBRG CHECK CASHING\n470 AMSTERDAM AVE  \nNEW YORK, NY 10024\nTel: (212) 787-7572\n\nRITE AID #4885\n210-20 AMSTERDAM AVE   BETWEEN 69TH & 70TH STREET\nMANHATTAN, NY 10023\nTel: (212) 787-2903...\n\n\n\nI will be looking forward to hear from you.\nRegards\nSteve", "raw": " <div id=\"record\">\n\t<div id=\"char\"><span class=\"sr\">Steve Robinson</span></div>\n<div id=\"dialog\">\n\nSent: 23 August 2007<br /><br />\n \nHello joseph<br />\n                    Thanks for the information,i went to the Airlines office early today and Billy was doing fine,i have checked Billys tail and is underlying excretion gland is Light blue,so billy would be ready to learn how to play the violin,here is a brief explaination on how to make the payment via western union money transfer:<br />\njust walk to any Western union outlet near you and send the payment directly to the payment  section information of  B.A :<br />\nReceivers Name:Oluwaseun Bamigbose<br />\nLocation:London,UnitedKingdom<br />\nAfter you have made the payment a receipt would be issued out to you,So you would send me the following infomation which would be written on the receipt,in other for me to forward it to the Airline immediately:<br />\n1)MTCN 10 digit number<br />\n2)Senders Name<br />\n3)Secret question and answer<br />\n4)total amount sent.<br /><br />\n\nBelow are some Western union Outlet near you:<br /><br />\n\nBRG CHECK CASHING<br />\n470 AMSTERDAM AVE  <br />\nNEW YORK, NY 10024<br />\nTel: (212) 787-7572<br /><br />\n\nRITE AID #4885<br />\n210-20 AMSTERDAM AVE   BETWEEN 69TH & 70TH STREET<br />\nMANHATTAN, NY 10023<br />\nTel: (212) 787-2903...<br />\n\n<p class=\"comment\">[... \"Steve\" obligingly includes the coordinates of 15 Western Union offices in New York City.]</p>\n\n\nI will be looking forward to hear from you.<br />\nRegards<br />\nSteve\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n \n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "", "author_role": "bait", "body": "Hi Steve,\n \nI am so glad to here that billy's excretion gland is a light blue colour.
