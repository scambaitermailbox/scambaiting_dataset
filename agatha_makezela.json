I got your contact through the South African Information Exchange (S.A.I.E) here  in South Africa and I decided to write for your assistance.\n\nMy late  husband was among the few black Zimbabwean well-to-do farmers murdered in  cold blood by supporters and agents of the ruling government of president Robert Mugabe for their alleged support and sympathy for the Zimbabwean opposition party controlled and sponsored by the whites minority. Before his death, he had took me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of US$ 27.8 Million Dollars(TWENTY SEVEN MILLION EIGTH HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATE DOLLARS)with a security and finance company as if he knew the looming Danger about to happen in Zimbabwe.\n\nThe money was deposited in a box as treasures With security company to avoid the possibility of knowing that it  was money and has an insured cover.This money was earmarked for the purchase of machinery?s and chemicals for his farms and the establishment of new farms in neighboring countries Malawi and Mozambique.\n\nThe land problem arose  when President Robert Mugabe introduced a new land Reform Act that wholly  affects all the well-to-do farmers most of them whites.Some few blacks vehemently condemned the system adopted by the government  that resulted to rampant killing and mob actions by the war veterans some political supporters which hundred of people been killed. However, heads of government from the westernworld especially the Britain and the United States of America have voiced their condemnation of mugabe,s plans.consequent upon this,the Southern African Development Community (S.A.D.C)has continuously supported Mugabe?s new land reforms Acts.\n\nIt is against this back ground that I and my family who are currently residing in the Republic of South Africa have decided to transfer this amount out of South Africa into a foreign bank account.\n\nAs a widow, I am confronted with the responsibility of seeking a reliable and honest person or persons with genuine foreign bank account where this money could be transferred into without much taxation and problem of being defrauded. I am faced with the problem of investing this amount of money in the South Africa because my country and South Africa have almost the same political history. Moreso, the South African foreign policy on political asylums does not allow such investment since I am residing under such status(asylumseeker.)As a businessman whom I am going to entrust my future and that of my family in his hands,I must let you know that this transaction is 100% riskfree.\n\nTherefore, if you accept to assist my family,and me, we are willing to offer you 30% of the total sum of your assistance, 65% will be for my family while 5% will be used for all expenses.
