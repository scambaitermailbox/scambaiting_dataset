C\n \nHere is the text of the fax:\n\nATTN: Bean Kounter\nSIR 04/27/06\nDuring the recent G8 (Summits) held in Sea Island, the president of Nigeria \u00d0 Chief Olusegun Obasanjo made a request to obtain a One Billion Dollar (US$1Billion) Loan to offset the debt owed its foreign contractors. The White House had resolved with the Nigerian government that they would support them to plead with World bank for the loan of US$1Billion.\nOUR MISSION: We have agreed to work assiduously with some agencies and representatives of the Nigerian government in dissolving this Economic Impasse. We are to carry out from records made available to us, Attestation, vetting Reconciliation and direct payment of genuinely cleared contract payment claim a contained in contract award files handed over to us. We are not unmindful of the frivolous and fraudulent machinations of people and agents of government trusted with state responsibility through diversion of Money meant for contract payment and outright denial of payment to contractors on the premise of fabricated reasons as reported on our bulletin of Dec. 17, 2005.\nOne of the conditions for the granting of such loan to Nigerian Government is a direct involvement of World bank officials for efficient handling of these contract payment by World bank personnel's, which the government of Nigeria consented to. The World bank has finally granted the request of the people and government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to mediate in the age long impasse of payment of all outstanding contract payment inherited from the deposed Military government till date.\nIn Lieu of the aforementioned, we write to notify you that you can make a claim on your contract payment now from Nigerian Government but due to the numerous fraudulent activities occurring in Nigeria, whereby contractor's fund are being diverted by bank officials and illegal fees are imposed on contractor's in order frustrate genuine contractors from receiving their contract entitlement, you are advised to contact DR SULE LA MIDO, whom is a Diplomat and also Minister for Foreign Affairs in Nigeria for further directives on your payment and he will be leaving traveling to LONDON for the realize of your payment which can be paid to you upon his arrival in LONDON to avoid being a victim to these numerous fraudster claiming to be in position of paying beneficiaries.\n \nIn the spirit of been our brothers keeper, you are advised to contact DR SULE LAMIDO on his Email address: minister_foreign_affairsdept@yahoo.com for further assistance and legal advises on whom to deal with in the office in Nigeria. If you are already dealing with any officials/offices in Nigeria, you also advise to contact him so as to verify if the person(s) or office(s) you are dealing with are genuine government officials because a lot of people has fallen victim to these gang of fraudster.\nThanks for your understanding.", "----------------------------------------------------------------------------"], "messages": [{"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "Good day Sir,", "author_role": "scam", "body": "Good day Sir,\n\nIn my corporation, a contract was given by the Federal Government of\nNigeria to the customs and exercise and is super headed by my\noffice.\n\nAnd reason of contacting you through this mail is to seek your kind\ninterest and acceptance to co-operate with me, divert to your care\nfor a feature investment under your supervision in your company in\nyour country, the sum of $xxxx US Dollars which figure I\nhave manipulated and covered up with over invoicing.\n\nblah blah blah\n\nFinally, as you are aware, I am a civil servant still in government\nservice, and I would not want my name to be tarnish therefore, I\nplead your indulgence to handle this transaction with TOPMOST SECRET\nAND CONFIDENTIALITY YOU CAN AFFORD.\n\nREGARDS,\nSule Lamido", "raw": "<hr>\n<span class=\"sl\">Dr. Sule Lamido</span><br><br><span class=\"st\">\n\nSubject: Good day Sir,<br><br>\n\nGood day Sir,<br><br>\n\nIn my corporation, a contract was given by the Federal Government of\nNigeria to the customs and exercise and is super headed by my\noffice.<br><br>\n\nAnd reason of contacting you through this mail is to seek your kind\ninterest and acceptance to co-operate with me, divert to your care\nfor a feature investment under your supervision in your company in\nyour country, the sum of $xxxx US Dollars which figure I\nhave manipulated and covered up with over invoicing.<br><br>\n\nblah blah blah<br><br>\n\nFinally, as you are aware, I am a civil servant still in government\nservice, and I would not want my name to be tarnish therefore, I\nplead your indulgence to handle this transaction with TOPMOST SECRET\nAND CONFIDENTIALITY YOU CAN AFFORD.<br><br>\n\nREGARDS<br>,<br>\nSule Lamido\n</span><br><br>\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "", "author_role": "bait", "body": "Dear Dr. Lamido\nCould you please explain what this contract is all about?

However, much as we remain comforted to know that you will be in Lagos on the 8th Dec. 2005, it has been brought to my knowledge in view of the discovered documentary discrepancies recorded in your file that, it will not be in your interest to transact your matter in Lagos. Although we remain willing to proceed with you on the status-quo terms, unfortunately, upon thorough examination of records it was discovered that your payment was among the list of foreign contract payments recently suspended by order of the Controller and Accountant General Dept. of Federal Ministry of Finance (Presidency). This was to enable the CAGD to investigate and determine the authenticity and existence of such companies and their financial claims. The suspension was also to help establish whether the companies had indeed executed such contracts and services for the listed government ministries and agencies (especially the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation and other prime parastatals) for which the CBN had to effect transfers. This situation was prompted by the recent revelations by the CBN on the fraudulent activities of some government officials in collaboration with the payroll processing unit of CBN who engage in illegal foreign transfers to the accounts owned by such fraudulent Companies. To this extent, we have re-arrived on definite details towards successful accomplishment of your matter without procedural bottlenecks and upfront financial commitment. The new procedure as instructed by Hon. Dr. Sule Lamido involves an arrangement whereby your funds will be released in cash money from Federal Government of Nigeria special tender funds meant for settlement of International depts. of the West Africa Gas Pipeline Co. in Accra Ghana. By the prevailing arrangement, you will have to come to Ghana to attend to the expected banking proceedings. You will be expected to open a non-resident account with Standard Chartered bank Accra where the cash money will be deposited upon release by the International Payment Office of WAGPC.. There is an existing agreement between CBN and SCB for accommodation of such cash payments and ensure its injection into the financial system for subsequent outflow on bank to bank basis. The documentary insufficiency to authenticate your beneficiary claims will be taken care of by the content of the agreement between CBN and SCB and we intend to exploit these payment clauses in your case. Your stay in Ghana will be for 2 days only and the Honorable Minister has already resolved to be sincerely helpful in your payment course. It will not be in our interest for you to embark on a fruitless payment journey to Lagos for your payment since there is lack of sufficient beneficiary documentation to support the payment in your favour. I will herewith suggest that you re-schedule your flight to Accra on the same date of your expected arrival in Lagos. In the meantime I will wait to receive your response before deciding to accredit your payment among the listed transfers scheduled through this privileged source of CBN contract debt settlement.

So Mr. Bean Kounter aks me witch way is the Luggage Deportment, on account he needs to buy a new suitcase for a trip to London. So as I points him in the rite direckshun.\nThen woe is me, about 10 minits later, Mrs. Louise Lewes comes into the Walmart, she bein back from her road trip. She says she gonna be makin a trip to London, and she wants to know if Walmart sells some speshul razer to shave her ****.\nI tells Mrs. Lewes I ain't never heerd about any such razer, and then I tells Mrs. Lewes that Mr. Bean Kounter jest came in to the Walmart to buy a suitcase, and he be goin to London, too.\nAnd now, Dr. Sule, I be so sorry fer what I said, on account Mrs. Lewes gets real egsited, her thinkin Mr. Kounter was in jail fer killin her husband, the late Hugh Lewes, and not knowin that the jury said not gilty. Mrs. Lewes goes runnin off to look fer Mr. Kounter. And from what they say, when Mrs. Lewes finds Mr. Kounter she calls him all kindsa names fer killin her late husband, Hugh Lewes.\nThen, God fergive us, Dr. Sule, Mrs. Lewes pulls out a gun and shoots Mr. Bean Kounter in the head. I go runnin over when I hears the gunshot, and I aks Mrs. Lewes to give me the gun. She says \" I have avenged the death of poor Hugh\". Then she says what sounds like this, \"My Back Man don't love me\", whatever that means don't nobody know, and then she says \"I go now to meet my late husband in Hevvin\". And then she puts the gun to her head, and shoots herself dead.\nNow we got 2 peeples dead, and what a waist.\nSo be it, Dr. Sule.

So Mr. Bean Kounter aks me witch way is the Luggage Deportment, on account he needs to buy a new suitcase for a trip to London. So as I points him in the rite direckshun.<br>\nThen woe is me, about 10 minits later, Mrs. Louise Lewes comes into the Walmart, she bein back from her road trip. She says she gonna be makin a trip to London, and she wants to know if Walmart sells some speshul razer to shave her ****.<br>\nI tells Mrs. Lewes I ain't never heerd about any such razer, and then I tells Mrs. Lewes that Mr. Bean Kounter jest came in to the Walmart to buy a suitcase, and he be goin to London, too.\nAnd now, Dr. Sule, I be so sorry fer what I said, on account Mrs. Lewes gets real egsited, her thinkin Mr. Kounter was in jail fer killin her husband, the late Hugh Lewes, and not knowin that the jury said not gilty. Mrs. Lewes goes runnin off to look fer Mr. Kounter. And from what they say, when Mrs. Lewes finds Mr. Kounter she calls him all kindsa names fer killin her late husband, Hugh Lewes.<br>\nThen, God fergive us, Dr. Sule, Mrs. Lewes pulls out a gun and shoots Mr. Bean Kounter in the head. I go runnin over when I hears the gunshot, and I aks Mrs. Lewes to give me the gun. She says \" I have avenged the death of poor Hugh\". Then she says what sounds like this, \"My Back Man don't love me\", whatever that means don't nobody know, and then she says \"I go now to meet my late husband in Hevvin\". And then she puts the gun to her head, and shoots herself dead.<br>\nNow we got 2 peeples dead, and what a waist.<br>\nSo be it, Dr. Sule. And now please join me in prayer fer our dear departed Louise Lewes, and Bean Kounter, and oh yeah, Hugh Lewes too.<br>\nHere goes:<br>\nOur father, witch art in Hevvin, Harold be thy name.<br>\nThy Kingdom comes, thy will be done on earth as it is in hevvin.<br>\nGive us this day our jelly bread, and lead us not into Penn Station, but deliver us from evil fraud stars.<br>\nAMEN<br><br>\n \nGRANDIOSA MAMMARIA STUPENDULOSA EST.<br>\nReverend Quentin Klucks\n\n\n</span><br><br>\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "", "author_role": "scam", "body": "May 15, 2006\nQuentin Klucks\ni dont know what to say about this sad news u gave me . may the almigth GOD be with there soul.\ndr sule\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscamorama main street \n* \nget booked \n*", "raw": "<hr>\n<span class=\"sl\">Dr. Sule Lamido</span><br><br><span class=\"st\">\n \n\n \nMay 15, 2006<br><br>\nQuentin Klucks<br>\ni dont know what to say about this sad news <span class=\"u\">u</span> gave me . may the almigth GOD be with there soul.<br>\ndr sule\n</span><br><br>\n<span class=\"llc\">AMEN, BROTHER, AMEN!!!</span><br><br>\n\n</td>\n\n<td width=15%></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<br>\n<center>\n<p>\n<font size=-1>\n<a href=\"http://www.scamorama.com\"><b>scamorama main street</b></a> \n* \n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1932857389?ie=UTF8&tag=wwwscamoramco-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1932857389\" target=\"blank\"><b>get booked</b></a><img src=\"http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wwwscamoramco-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1932857389\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\" /> \n* \n", "comments": []}]}
