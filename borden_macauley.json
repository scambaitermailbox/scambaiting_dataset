SMITH SHAW.\nLAGOS NIGERIA.\nDear Beloved in Christ Ellie Borden,\n     It is by the grace of God that I received Christ, knowing the truth and the truth shall set me free. Having known the truth, I had no choice than to do what is lawful and right in the sight of God for eternal life and in the sight of man for witness of God's mercy and glory upon my life. I have the pleasure to share my testimony with you, having seen your contact from the Internet, and also prayed over it, God revealed to me that you are genuine hearted and can do is work.\n     I was formerly BARRISTER MACAULEY KOLA JONES,but now EVANGELIST BARRISTER MACAULEY MARK  the legal adviser to late Mr.and Mrs.Smith Shaw a British couple that lived in my Country Nigeria for 15 years,before they both died in a plane crash some years ago. These couples were good Christians, they so dedicated to God all they had because they had no child till they died. Throughout their stay in my country, they acquired a lot of properties like lands, houses, part of which was \"WILLED\" TO ME etc. As their legal adviser then, before their death, the husband Mr. Smith Shaw instructed me to write their  WILL. Because they had no child, they dedicated their wealth to God. According to the WILL, the properties have to be sold and the money be given out to a ministry for the work of God, such as orphanage homes, charity homes, churches etc. \n   As their legal adviser, all the documents for the properties were in my care. He gave me the authority to sell the properties and give out the fund to the Ministries for the work of God and to help the less privileged. In short, after their death, I sold all the properties as instructed and I was able to realized $15,000,000.00 (Fifteen million US dollars).But Instead of giving the fund out for the work of God as instructed by the owner before his death, I converted the fund to myself with the intention of investing the fund abroad for my personal use. (God forgive me)\n   After selling all their property, to raise money, I then deposited the money in a bank for investment purpose, infact, the money is presently in the bank, Financial Trust Bank. I had encounter with Christ when Pastor Benny Hinn was preaching on television concerning Ananias and Saphira in Acts 5:1-11. After hearing the word of God, I gave my life to Christ and became a born again Christian. As a born again Christian, I started reading my bible and one day, the Lord opened my eyes to Ezekiel 33: 18 and 19 where the word of God says: \"When the righteous truth from his righteousness, and committee iniquity, he shall even die thereby. But if the wicked turn from his wickedness, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby\". From the scripture, I discovered that the only way I could have peace in my life is to do what is lawful and right by giving out the fund as instructed for the work of God by the owner before his death.\n   I have asked God for forgiveness and I know that God has forgiven me. But I have to do what is lawful and right in the sight of God by giving out the fund to the chosen ministry for the purpose of God's work as instructed by the owner before his death,Shortly after this, the Asian Tsunami Disaster incident came up, and I felt bitter as I saw thousands die and flooded away by the terrible storm. I then decided t help by donating the money to the victims so as to fulfill the work of God and to have a rest of mind.\n   But I do not want to be tempted any more, as I am okay with the little I have,and that which was given to me by the late Philanthropist  for I may be tempted to keep this money for my personal self, in as much as it is still with me. But I want someone to help me accomplish this mission.\n   After my fasting and prayers, I asked God to make his choice and direct me to an honest\nChristian or the chosen ministry that deserves this fund by his Grace. I then came across your address on the Internet as, and I prayed over it and so I contacted you I was browsing through a site, and as a matter of fact, it is not only you or your ministry that I picked on the site initially, but after my fervent prayer over it, then you were nominated to me through divine revelation from God, so these are how I received such a divine revelation from the Lord, how I got your contact information, and I then I decided to contact you for the fund to be used wisely for things that will glorify the name of God. \n   I have notified the bank where I deposited the funds that any moment from now, the funds would be claimed. So if you know that you will really use this funds honestly for things that will glorify God's name, then do urgently contact me back through my alternate email address at (macauley@excite.co.uk and also macauleymark2005@yahoo.com.au) and the details will be given to you on how you will be able to receive the fund in your country through the bank. \n   You should also forward to me your telephone and fax number for easy communication and to send you the documents concerning the funds.

I also pray along with you and others for their eternal life and mercy from God, so that he may forgive them for all their wrong doings.\n            As for the administration of the funds, i must express my sincere gratitude for your honesty, this has built so much confidence in me, that you are truly worthy of this mission, and i will leave no stone unthrown to ensure the funds get to you.\n              Since there are some minor fees, that you definately will have to pay before the final release of the funds, which can not be deducted from the $15m, i have prayed over this and i am happy to tell you that you can have 20% of the whole funds to yourself while the remaining 80% goes out for the intended purpose.(charity mission) I must also once again show my sincere appreciation over your genuine concern about the administration of the funds. You honesty has indeed earned you the 20%.\n             As for the means of transfer, it is left to you to decide that, you may choose to have the funds transfered into your personal account, or you may open a separete account for the transfer. But i suggest you have the money transfered to your personal account, you have no reason to worry yourself about the amount of money involved, as my legal experience of about 22 years will ensure success and a hitch free transfer.\n       The most important thing right now, is confidentiality on your part, as any bridge of confidentiality would result into brigde in our agreement.BE INFORMED. The world of full of evil doers, and therefore, one needs to be careful in handling a huge project as this.

As for prayer, you are always in my thought, and the almighty lord, who has directed me to you, to make you a sole benefactor of this mission, will surely see you through all your problems.<br>\n          It is also rather sad to hear about the death of your parents, well, i want you to take heart and believe that there is a reason for all calamity trhat befalls man in this life. I also pray along with you and others for their eternal life and mercy from God, so that he may forgive them for all their wrong doings.<br>\n            As for the administration of the funds, i must express my sincere gratitude for your honesty, this has built so much confidence in me, that you are truly worthy of this mission, and i will leave no stone unthrown to ensure the funds get to you.<br>\n              Since there are some minor fees, that you definately will have to pay before the final release of the funds, which can not be deducted from the $15m, i have prayed over this and i am happy to tell you that you can have 20% of the whole funds to yourself while the remaining 80% goes out for the intended purpose.(charity mission) I must also once again show my sincere appreciation over your genuine concern about the administration of the funds. You honesty has indeed earned you the 20%.<br>\n             As for the means of transfer, it is left to you to decide that, you may choose to have the funds transfered into your personal account, or you may open a separete account for the transfer. But i suggest you have the money transfered to your personal account, you have no reason to worry yourself about the amount of money involved, as my legal experience of about 22 years will ensure success and a hitch free transfer.<br>\n       The most important thing right now, is confidentiality on your part, as any bridge of confidentiality would result into brigde in our agreement.BE INFORMED. The world of full of evil doers, and therefore, one needs to be careful in handling a huge project as this. You should only disclose this to anyone after the transfer of the funds into your bank account, which would be actualised within the next couple of days.<br>\nI expect your response<br>\nYours in the Lord.<br>\nEvan. Macauley Mark.\n\n<br><br>\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "", "author_role": "bait", "body": "Lizzie says \"OK\".\n\n\n  Date:\t  \tThu, 31 Mar 2005\n  \n\nMr. MacAuley,\n\nYou message gives me heart.
