Of all\nmy most favourite scambaits, not a single one of them involved extracting\ncash - or even a trophy picture - from the scammer. It is much more\nsatisfying to drive a scammer mentally insane over a period of weeks\nor months than it is to spend a week or so convincing them to send\nyou a bit of cash. None of my own cash only baits are remotely near\nany of my favourite baits in terms of overall satisfaction.\nPlease do not send requests to me asking how to receive\nmoney from scammers. I no longer attempt any kind of cash baiting\nmyself. I tested the waters to see if it could be achieved, now\nI'm looking for bigger and better ways to get these guys.\nAny emails requesting information on cash baiting\nOf course I cannot force you not to try cash baiting\ndon't do it!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"], "author_role": "bait", "body": "Dear Shelodon,\nIt has been some time since you contacted me, so I guess you have\ngiven up on ever seeing your $50 again. Well, it's time to let you\ninto a little secret. YOU HAVE BEEN SCAMMED! You see, my name is\nnot really Stuart Fielding. I am not a businessman at all.\nFrom the very first email you sent me I knew that you were a 419\nscammer, a liar and of course a common thief. There is no widow,\nand there is no $66 million dollars. I have been wasting your time\nand resources making you think you were going to get a big payment\nfrom a stupid rich businessman when in fact I am the one who has\nscammed YOU!\nJust think how dumb you are going to look when your friend and\ncolleagues read all about how such and idiot like you send ME a\npayment of FIFTY DOLLARS. What a STUPID thing to do. You can't be\nmuch of a good scammer if you keep sending your victims money can\nyou?!\nOf course, I will not want to keep your filthy stolen money, so\nI decided to let you see what I have done with it. I hope you enjoy\nthe photographs.\nGoodbye!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "to_name": "Comrade Shelodon Venture", "date": "", "subject": ""}], "location": "Johannesburg, South Africa", "scammer": "Comrade Shelodon Venture", "baiter": "Shiver Metimbers"}
