It is one of the most widely cultivated tree fruits, and the most widely known of the many members of genus Malus that are used by humans.\nThe tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor is still found today. There are more than 7,500 known cultivars of apples, resulting in a range of desired characteristics. Cultivars vary in their yield and the ultimate size of the tree, even when grown on the same rootstock.\n\n\nRegarding the contract, in law, a contract is a legally binding agreement between two or more parties which, if it contains the elements of a valid legal agreement, is enforceable by law or by binding arbitration. A legally enforceable contract is an exchange of promises with specific legal remedies for breach. These can include compensatory remedy, whereby the defaulting party is required to pay monies that would otherwise have been exchanged were the contract honoured, or an Equitable remedy such as Specific Performance, in which the person who entered into the contract is required to carry out the specific action they have reneged upon.\nAgreement is said to be reached when an offer capable of immediate acceptance is met with a \"mirror image\" acceptance (i.e., an unqualified acceptance). \n\n\nThe parties must have the necessary capacity to contract and the contract must not be either trifling, indeterminate, impossible, or illegal. Contract law is based on the principle expressed in the Latin phrase pacta sunt servanda (usually translated \"agreements are to be kept\", but more literally \"pacts must be kept\"). Breach of contract is recognized by the law and remedies can be provided.\n\n\nAs long as the good or service provided is legal, any oral agreement between two parties can constitute a binding legal contract. The practical limitation to this, however, is that generally only parties to a written agreement have material evidence (the written contract itself) to prove the actual terms uttered at the time the agreement was struck. In daily life, most contracts can be and are made orally, such as purchasing a book or a sandwich. Sometimes written contracts are required by either the parties, or by statutory law within various jurisdiction for certain types of agreement, for example when buying a house or land.\nContract law can be classified, as is habitual in civil law systems, as part of a general law of obligations (along with tort, unjust enrichment or restitution).\n\n\nAccording to legal scholar Sir John William Salmond, a contract is \"an agreement creating and defining the obligations between two or more parties\".\nAs a means of economic ordering, contract relies on the notion of consensual exchange and has been extensively discussed in broader economic, sociological and anthropological terms (see \"Contractual theory\", below). In American English, the term extends beyond the legal meaning to encompass a broader category of agreements.\n\n\nThis article mainly concerns contract law in common law jurisdictions (approximately coincident with the English-speaking world and anywhere the British Empire once held sway). Common-law jurisdictions usually offer proceedings in the English language, which has become to an extent a lingua franca of international business. The common law retains a high degree of freedom of contract, with parties largely free to set their own terms, whereas civil-law systems typically apply certain over-arching principles to disputes arising out of contract (see, for example the French Civil Code). It is very common for businesses not located in common-law jurisdictions to opt in to the common law through a Choice of law clause.\n\n\nHowever, contract is a form of economic ordering common throughout the world, and different rules apply in jurisdictions applying civil law (derived from Roman law principles), Islamic law, socialist legal systems, and customary or local law.\n\n\nAwaiting your reply in order to proceed.\n\n\nBest regards,\n\n \nFranz Larzlo", "raw": "  <div id=\"record\">\n\t<div id=\"char\"><span class=\"fl\">Frank Larzlo</span>\t\n\t\t <p><img src=\"http://www.scamorama.com/images/larzlo-paul-apple.png\"></p>\n\t\t <p class=\"comment\">More important knowledge!</p>\n\t</div>\n\t<div id=\"dialog\" class=\"ast\">\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\nDate: Wed, 27 Oct 2010 14:42:41 +0200\n</p>\n\n\n<p>\nDear Paul,\n</p>\n \n<p>\nBefore sending you our contract, I would like to specify some points.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOur apple is the pomaceous fruit of the apple tree, species Malus domestica in the rose family (Rosaceae) and is a perennial.
