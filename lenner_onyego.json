I've been in the business of conducting international modalities since you were in elephant-skin diapers, or whatever they use to wrap up incontinent infants in Ghana. When I ask a question, you'd best believe that I have a damn good reason for asking it. I like to know what I'm getting into.\n \nSince, as you intimate, the money in Spain is actually the property of the Sierra Leonese government, that means we must keep this business absolutely discreet, since it actually involves the transfer of government assets out of a third country. Now that I know that, I absolutely insist on bringing in Mr. Foggs, as he is most experienced at this kind of subterfuge.\n \nVery well, then, send me the name, number and contact at this Spanish firm--I believe you said the name was Alpha Trust Securities--and I will make the necessary contact and send them my passport. Mr. Foggs of Foggs Financial will be copied in on all communications, but rest assured, he is a very discreet man. Thanks to his ministrations, I haven't paid taxes in close to 15 years, so that tells you what sort of chap he is.\n \nAs for you coming over here--well, now, that's an interesting wrinkle. Do you plan to settle in Waukepetonsett? Do I need to arrange living quarters? Respond immediately. Can't have a tribe of third world refugees and all their goats clogging up my front porch.

Success is certainly close!<br>\nAs regards to my trip to your Country, I think that should be just immediately the funds are moved from Spain to your country and as you can see, it is left for your to implore the Security Company in Spain to handle the matter with the urgency it requires for your collection of the deposit.\nIt is your duty to inform me when to get read for my trip to your Country. So far, I plan coming with my brother Daniel whom you will use part of the money to invest for him in your own establishment and any other viable portion you might suggest in your country.<br><br>\n\nFor your clarification, I am still a single woman and will be happy to spend the rest of my life with you. I believe we can live together comfortable.\nPlease feel free to ask any question.\n<br><br>\nIt is important you inform me by tomorrow when exactly I will be hoping to make the trip to meet you in your Country. Please confirm from the office in Spain how long it will take you to collect the deposit from their office.<br><br>\n\nI wait hearing from you tomorrow.<br>\nStay blessed.<br>\nYours,<br>\nEvang.
