I am still in hospital, on a lot of painkilling drugs, and sometimes I'm out for a day at a time or more. Plus I can't always get access to a computer here.\n\n\nAnyway, I have to clear up a few things.\n\n\n1) I like you. I like you al ot. Ever since we have been talking o nthe computer I am liking you more and more. So much so that I really believe we have a future together as man and wife.\n\n\n2) In my country it is essential that a man who wants to take a woman as his wife knows whether or not she has been with other men. If things are different in Dakar Senegal, then I am sorry, but that is the way things are here in the USA, and I can only behave according to the strict moral rules of my country.\n\n\n3) In my country it is utterly forbidden for a man to ask a woman directly if she has been with other men. This would be considered shockingly offensive and rude, so no one ever does it.\n\n\n4) To get round this, it is normal here in the USA for a man to ask someone who knows the woman, whether or not she has been with other men. Usually here in America this is the woman's pastor or priest or minister. But it maybe someone else, such as her mother, her father, her brother, perhaps her children, or another local dignitary such as the mayor, a policeman, a realtor, or a mountebank. Again, if things are different in Dakar Senegal then I am sorry but I can only go by what is the tradition here in the USA.\n\n\n5) So naturally, I thought that asking the reverend Nicholas Faith about your virginity was a sensible thing to do. Obviously I told him that he must not mention it to you, to avoid embarassing you. But what an idiot he is ! First he got angry with me ! ME ! of ALL people !!! I'm the one who is going to SAVE YOU from that refugee camp !!! How could he be angry with ME ????!!!!!!!????? And THEN, he TOLD YOU ABOUT IT !!! What a MORON !!!! Loveth dearest, I have told him that I think he is a lackey of LUCIFER, with Satan's blood running through his veins. I have told him that I will have nothing more to do with him. If he contacts me again, I will ignore him.\n\n\n6) I have also told him that YOU should shun him too, because of his evil heart, his satanic motives. And his dirty rotten morals.\n\n\n7) Loveth, I really think  can help you. I don't know if you've met him yet but he assures me that he has been in contact with you and he can help you. As he is also a reverend minister of God, it would be best I think if you can rely on him instead of that fool Reverend Nicholas Faith. Barrister Mykwile certainly writes in a strange way but he has been trustworthy with me so far.\n\n\n8) Loveth, dearest, the main thing is the answer to the question that I asked Reverend Faith. I'm sorry that you have had to answer it, but now that you have, I am delighted, and the way is clear for us to proceed with getting you out of that refugee camp.\n\n\nWhat's next darling ?\n\n\nKindest regards\n Nigel Ryan-Schama", "raw": "<hr />\n\n<p class=\"nrs\">\n19th Jan, Nigel Ryan-Schama to Loveth Hutu\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLoveth dearest I'm sorry for not replying sooner.
