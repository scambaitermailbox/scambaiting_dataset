I caught a glimpse of him walking around the company building, seeming like he was taking notes on something. The information I received back from my spies was inconclusive. I can only hope that he is not trying to deliberately overthrow my company. I just found out that my PA was scammed out of \u00a3125,000 by Mr. Strife, and he has refused to answer all my calls. My colleagues think I worry needlessly, but I know for certain that Mr. Strife has something planned.\n\n\nI understand that we have little time to waste, and it is best if we conclude this business quickly.
