Then for some reasons known only to yourself, you decide to sit on your fat arse doing nothing for a month just waiting for me to ask you what the problem is.\nNow that I have actually contacted you because you couldn't be bothered, you decide you want your payment in full from me, and that you are not going to send the replacements for the pitiful and unfinished work you have already sent to us?   You have deemed it in your infinite wisdom that you will no longer re-write the six pages, and you wait a MONTH to drag your sweaty buttocks off your chair to tell me that? Tell me Mr. Ifey, are the rest of your family as lazy and pompous as you are?\nLet me make it quite clear to you that you agreed to provide work to us in completed form, not in a form which takes on the appearance of having been vomited up by dog.
