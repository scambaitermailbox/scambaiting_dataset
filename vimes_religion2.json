A copy of your personal identification(i.e. your country passport or<br>\n>driver\u001as license).<br><br>\n\nThat can be done. But it doesn't mean it would be done. Identity Thefth is a\nmajor threat nowadays and I can't risk myself to be a victim of it.\nI don't distrust you, but maybe the copy of my passport is left uncared,\nsome cleaning lady without scruples enters, steals it and next thing I know\nis that I am in the FBI most wanted list.<br><br>\n\nAll I can do is to send you my DNI number (76.419.666), take it or leave it.\n<br><br>\n\n>2. A balance payment of 11,150.00euro for demurrage,storage and administrative<br>\n>charges which need to be made before the consignment is released from the\n>warehouse. <br><br>\n\nMrs. Jones told me that all these charges were set, that she had already\npaid for them. Anyway, perhaps our lawyer, Mr. Kingsley L. Stober, is more\naware of the situation. His email is crillawest@netscape.net and his\ntelephone is 0031-629-215-703.\nContact him and if there's something left unpaid he will take charge of it,\nhe has our power of attorney to dispose of our funds at will.<br><br>\n\n>3. Your presence will be required in our office in Amsterdam for you to sign<br>\n>all the documents relating to the release of the consignments.<br><br>\n\nThat's difficult, since I am in charge of Our Lady of Constant Distress\nMission of the Bethamithe Church, a religious organization committed to help\nthe less fortunates. In our case we are dedicated to the poor of the slums\ncalled Villa Tachito, in Argentina. Everyday we give two hot meals to 538\nkids and provide them and their families with clothes, job opportunities and\nsuch.<br>\nAs you can imagine, that requires for my constant presence there and\ntravelling would be very hard, if not impossible.<br>\nAnd, as you might have noticed, I am a Priest bounded to an Order. That\nmeans that I must ask for my superiors to travel freely, and, of course, to\ndispose of the money needed to buy the plane ticket.<br>\nAnyway, I'll see what I can do. Maybe if all this signing doesn't take too\nlong Brother Gustavo Lacear can take care of the Mission for some days.\n<br><br>\n\nYours in the Names of Jesus, Mary, Eloi and Betham<br><br>\n\nBrother SAMUEL VIMES<br><br>\n\n<i>Cultural note: DNI is the ID card in Argentina.
