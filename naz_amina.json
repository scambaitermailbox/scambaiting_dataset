Sometimes I wish I would be a taller man, but then I remember how wonderful it is when I can kiss a woman's mouth, while I am making the love with her.

I would be most overjoyed to help you with visas for you and your wonderful children, I would hope that you will find me a suitable man to you. <br>\nIf you will allow me, I will describe my looks to you, I am a man of average height and weight, 5'8\" (173cm) and 160# (72.5kg) I have wavy, dark brown hair and brown eyes. My skin is color like warm chocolate, I have all my teeth, and my age is 42. I played soccer-football when at University, and maintain my body to the way it was then. I lift weights, and swim and walk for health. I do not smoke the cigarettes or the cigars, but sometimes a pipe, in which I use a special chocolate blend that is most pleasing. Sometimes I wish I would be a taller man, but then I remember how wonderful it is when I can kiss a woman's mouth, while I am making the love with her. I love to sing in my life, and people tell me they like to hear me. I have a strong baritone voice. I do not drink, except occasional champagne at a celebration. I love to cook.<br>\nWould you think I am a man you will like, and love?

I may have to hire a few additional inspectors, but the training is rigorous, and I think some younger fellows feel this is too much for them, though we pay handsome salaries to trainees ($40,000.00 for the 8-month training period), some of them drop out of our training program.\n\nSecond, no, dearest heart, there is only one woman in my house, only my housekeeper, Mrs. Jardon, who is my treasure.

I will not contact them by phone until I am satisfied in all the particulars. You, yourself, even said that the Europeans talk fast!\n\nAnd last, I want you to know this, and believe this, and know that this will come from my heart to yours.

I do not need it, and I want you to have it. Every woman needs a \"nest egg\" of her own money, and this must be yours.\n\nMy wonderful, sweet girl, when I think of us together, it makes my heart sing, and makes me to dance like when I was a young boy.

Our inspections can arise at short notice, and sometimes, all we have time to do, is to pack a change of clothing! There is not even time to let anyone know of our departure.\n\nAlas, this was one of those times, and I apologize PROFUSELY to you for not telling you that I would be away. I could not even tell Miss Green to contact you, as you have stressed that you wish our love to remain private until we are sure of ourselves.\n\nI have returned (last evening) from a VERY difficult series of inspections, most of the members on the inspections list were quite long, and some of them were at the beginning stages, some half-way, some were almost at completion, but most of them were at a flaccid, almost-passive stage. It was frustrating to get them sorted out. We worked night and day! I will tell you that the secondary members were also satisfactory, but some were not up to our usual standards.\n\nAfter greeting Mrs. Jardon, who scolded me for not resting properly (as usual), and taking a well-earned bathe, then falling into my bed for nine hours of uninterrupted sleep (but with wonderful, happy, loving dreams of my sweet Amina) I wake refreshed this morning at 5AM, and went straightaway to my office. For once, I managed to be working at my desk before Miss Green arrived! She, too, scolded me for not resting enough on my trip, but she knows how much is involved, so she was not very saucy to me.\n\nAmina, darling Amina, I thought of you a thousand times, and each time, I smiled in my heart, as I think of your beautiful face, and your loving arms around me pulling me close to kiss my lips, to whisper my name, to draw me into your heart, and love me as no woman has ever loved me.\n\nI dream of what you suggested, that we go away alone together, and be apart from the world. I will arrange a mountain cabin, and there we can discover each other, and give our love room to grow. It is warm still in the evenings, and we will go for long walks by the mountain lake, and talk a million words, learning each other, and planning a future together. To hold you in my arms at day's end, we will be together in slumber, as in waking.\n\nI do not know if I can be away from my business for an entire month, but we can certainly be able to go away for 2 weeks. Then, should we marry, we will take a wonderful trip with our dear children, as a family, and travel to a good, wholesome family place where the children can run and play and have wonderul childhood memories.\nDarling Amina, I know your beloved husband must have loved you beyond life itself, and I know he would want you to be happy for the rest of your days, with a good man who will adore you, and appreciate you, and help you raise his children to become happy and worthy citizens of the world. If he did spoil you (and I know you deserved it, my love) it will also be my great pleasure to treat you to the finest things that Life has to offer! Whatever you need, or want, my sweet Amina, is yours for the asking--though I would be so happy to surprise you from time to time with a token of my affection for you, just to see the delight in your beautiful, dark eyes!\n\nI said it before, but I do not know if you are taking this seriously, my darling, but I want you to have and keep ALL your money. I have more than enough money to support us all for the rest of our lives. You must invest your money into a good, conservative bank that will be happy to infuse your money into their funds, and will pay you a fair interest. Even at 3.9% (which is LOW interest rate) your $10 millions of dollars will earn you $390,000 annually, which is a wonderful piece of money!\n\nI am so pleased that you are gladdened by my mails. It gives me joy to write them to you, and to think of you as I write them. My wonderful, sweet girl, knowing that you read my mails gives my heart a peace, a contented and fulfilled happiness, that I was afraid I would never find.\n\nI am yours forever, Raymondo", "raw": "<hr>\n<span class=\"rnc\">\nGotta let Amina stew for a couple of days, while I go out and try to earn a living. I sent this Tuesday morning...\n\n</span><br><br>\n\n\n<span class=\"rn\">RAYMONDO NAZMANIAN</span><br><br><span class=\"ast\">\n\n\nMy darling Amina,<br><br>\n\nAs I must tell you, and you should always know, my business, Nazmanian Shortarm Inspections, INC, is one of the few of its kind in the world, and as such, at times we can be quite busy! Our inspections can arise at short notice, and sometimes, all we have time to do, is to pack a change of clothing! There is not even time to let anyone know of our departure.\n<br><br>\nAlas, this was one of those times, and I apologize PROFUSELY to you for not telling you that I would be away. I could not even tell Miss Green to contact you, as you have stressed that you wish our love to remain private until we are sure of ourselves.\n<br><br>\nI have returned (last evening) from a VERY difficult series of inspections, most of the members on the inspections list were quite long, and some of them were at the beginning stages, some half-way, some were almost at completion, but most of them were at a flaccid, almost-passive stage. It was frustrating to get them sorted out. We worked night and day! I will tell you that the secondary members were also satisfactory, but some were not up to our usual standards.\n<br><br>\nAfter greeting Mrs. Jardon, who scolded me for not resting properly (as usual), and taking a well-earned bathe, then falling into my bed for nine hours of uninterrupted sleep (but with wonderful, happy, loving dreams of my sweet Amina) I wake refreshed this morning at 5AM, and went straightaway to my office. For once, I managed to be working at my desk before Miss Green arrived! She, too, scolded me for not resting enough on my trip, but she knows how much is involved, so she was not very saucy to me.\n<br><br>\nAmina, darling Amina, I thought of you a thousand times, and each time, I smiled in my heart, as I think of your beautiful face, and your loving arms around me pulling me close to kiss my lips, to whisper my name, to draw me into your heart, and love me as no woman has ever loved me.\n<br><br>\nI dream of what you suggested, that we go away alone together, and be apart from the world. I will arrange a mountain cabin, and there we can discover each other, and give our love room to grow. It is warm still in the evenings, and we will go for long walks by the mountain lake, and talk a million words, learning each other, and planning a future together. To hold you in my arms at day's end, we will be together in slumber, as in waking.\n<br><br>\nI do not know if I can be away from my business for an entire month, but we can certainly be able to go away for 2 weeks. Then, should we marry, we will take a wonderful trip with our dear children, as a family, and travel to a good, wholesome family place where the children can run and play and have wonderul childhood memories.<br>\nDarling Amina, I know your beloved husband must have loved you beyond life itself, and I know he would want you to be happy for the rest of your days, with a good man who will adore you, and appreciate you, and help you raise his children to become happy and worthy citizens of the world.

I find myself whistling and humming all the time, and the people in my office, (especially Miss Rachel Green) think I am also crazy. Tell your dear Mum that she is not alone in thinking YOU are crazy, so we will just have to be crazy together, my Darling Amina, and let our loved ones shake their heads at us!! I laugh to think of that!\n\nI am busy this morning, going over my accounts of last month with my bookkeeper, Monica Geller (you remember, I told you that she and my driver, Hugh are going to be married, they will wed in late October, the 25th, and she is getting anxious for her big day!) and we should finish all these accounts by late this morning. This is a job that I do not like, as I find \"shuffling papers\" to be quite tedious. But if one is to have a successful business, one must oversee ALL aspects of the thing, and that includes the tedious jobs.\n\nI would rather be out doing the inspections, and being a \"hands-on\" worker. (To do Shortarm Inspections properly, all the preparations must be done under cover, so as to achieve the beneficial final result). All parties must be well-satisfied, all the way, in every way. It is carefully planned from start to finish, the initial advances for the Inspections must be made by people who are the best-qualified to handle the members from start to finish.\n\nI am thrilled that you are thinking in terms of us becoming man and wife! We should not want to draw attention away from Hugh and Monica on their big celebration, so we will keep our joy very low-key. It is perfectly fine to tell others of our plans and dreams, but we should not want to appear that we wish to upstage the Bride and Groom! That would not be kind to them, and would make US look selfish and foolish. We would like to do everything right.\n\nAs I am writing this to you, Hugh is driving me to my office, there I will send this to you right away. You should hear him chatter on and on about his Monica! You would think they are the only people on Earth who plan to marry! He can scarcely wait to enjoy married love--he has the highest respect for Miss Geller, and for the sanctity of marriage, and they neither one, have tasted physical pleasures, so they are nearly beside themselves with anticipation. How many young people nowdays will respect chastity until the marriage bed? Not many, I am sure--I cannot tell you how I admire them for their honor and obedience to moral law! This is only one of the many reasons why I value both of them so highly, they are young people of enormous integrity!\n\nYou must rest assured and not worry your beautiful head, my wonderful Amina, about money to travel to me. I will transfer the funds to your Citibank account this afternoon, so that you can get everything you need to come to my waiting arms. Thank you for giving me the information. (You wrote that you had sent them, but with all the stress on your mind, you must have forgot.) You will not have to endure stress from now on, Dearest one, ahead of us will be smooth and sure. By all means, leave the finer automobile for your dear Mum for her use, until we will arrange for her to come to USA to live near us. (she does want to live in America?)\n\nAbout you making attire for me, what a wonderful and generous gesture for you to do this! I am honored by your thoughtfulness, and I will wear it with great pride, knowing is is from my Amina's loving hands! Tell me, is the garment a dashiki, that is what we Americans call the long, comfortable robe of many colors. I understand that when a man wears such a grand attire, he will not wear any underclothing, which is a very good thing, as I find most of them to be far too tight for my manhood.

I know I should not have pried into his private e-mail files, but I did look at all the letters you and Raymond have sent back and forth, and now I am very glad I did snoop into his letters.\n\nI am surprised and rather angry that he would tease you this way. And some of the love-talk he wrote you--I didn't know he was even aware of those kinds of things! He doesn't even have a girlfriend, yet! These days, we mothers have responsibility to see to it that our children do not get themselves into serious trouble--and the Internet makes it very easy for children or teenagers to become involved in potentially-dangerous situations. You understand, I am sure.\n\nApparently, you and Ray have been corresponding for some time, and I feel it is my duty as his mother to set you straight. Ray is NOT a 42-year-old wealthy American businessman, he is a 16-year-old High School Junior, who is in school at this very moment, and will go to his marching-band practice this afternoon (he plays trumpet, and very well, too, I may add!)\n\nThere is no \"Nazmanian Shortarm Inspections, INC\" but he does mow the lawns of some of our neighbors, for spending money, and he is a stock-boy at the Piggly-Wiggly grocery store.\n\nThere is no housekeeper (except me, of course) named Mrs. Jardon, and no driver Hugh Jardon, (just me again-- I will be glad when he gets his driver's license, and can drive himself. He is saving money to buy a car). And NO bookkeeper named Miss Monica Geller, ( just our tax accountant, Mrs. June Cleaver.)\n\nMy name is Rachel Green, and I am the mother of Raymond Green (NOT \"Raymondo Nazmanian\", as he wrote to you) and I am not \"a thin, scrawny spinster lady, who thinks she is my mother\" I am almost as fat as you are, and I KNOW I am his mother!!! And, by the way, we aren't Black, we're Caucasian, complete with blond hair and green eyes. And a few freckles.\n\nThe photos he sent you are of a very popular American actor/comedian, Steve Harvey. I don't blame you for being thrilled that \"Raymondo\" is so atttractive, as Mr. Harvey is a VERY handsome man. So is Ray, but he is just an intelligent and literate 16-year-old American teenager with a little too much time on his hands. (I plan to fix THAT!!!!)\n\nI am sorry that he led you on this chase, you should know that I will give Raymond a very stern lecture about this. Please accept my apology for the inconvenience this must have caused you.\n\nSincerely, Mrs. Rachel Green", "raw": "<hr>\n<span class=\"rnc\">OH NO!!! Busted by MOM!!
