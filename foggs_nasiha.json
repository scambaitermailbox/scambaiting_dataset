Briefly, I am a Sudanese National and the wife of late Dr. Jameel \nFoggs, Until his death, my husband was the Chief Executive of the Diamond \nMine in kanema, southern Sudan.\n\nOn April 6 2004 Rebels (Arab Militias) invaded the diamond mine And \nassassinated my husband, mistaking him for his brother Mohammed Jameel, who \nis a top Government official and special aide to the president. When the \nnews reached me, I Hurriedly gathered some aluables in our family villa and \nescaped in the company of our Only son Atif Jameel.\n\nAmong the valuables was a file that contained details of a deposit my \nhusband made in a security company in Lome, Togo. The document stated that \nmy late Husband deposited 9.5 million US dollars contained in a trunk box in \nthe name of our son Atif. The deposit was registered as family valuables and \nart works. I believe my late husband made this fortune from the sale of Gold \nand diamonds during his time as the Executive Director of the diamond mining \ncorporation.\n\nNow that we are in Togo and verified the existence of this deposit, we need \nyour assistance to move this deposit out of Lome for investment in your \ncountry as we cannot invest here due to our status as political refugees. I \nam proposing to give you 10% of the total sum (9.5 million US Dollars) and \n15% share in any investment we will embark upon if you assist us.\n\nWe will also set aside 3% of the funds for incidental expenses which you \ncould make in course of this transaction (fax messages, phone calls, air \ntickets etc). I am making this proposal in good faith believing that you \nwill not disappoint us knowing the difficult situation we are facing here in \nWest Africa.\n\nI will ask you to treat the existence of these funds as top secret for \nsecurity reasons. Your urgent response will be appreciated as I will \npersonally arrange towards getting this fund into your country through \ndiplomatic means. Also,send me your telephone number so that you can talk \nwith my son  Atif Jameel, further. I am optimistic that this fund will be \nsafe in your hands, as a reputable person that you are.

He is a good man, but is also a racist, a blowhard and a closet homosexual. I warned you Mr. Lenner is rude, but he has the money we need to get your money. I beg you to please overlook his weakness.  I only hope your lawyer isn't too angry.  Please ask him not to be angry with me since I cannot control Mr. Lenner. <br><br>\n\nBelow is the flight information for our travel to South Africa on August 1.

I don't spend all day chained to my telephone.  I have clients all over the Midwest and on the East Coast.  I spend as much time in the airplane as I do on the ground.  If I am near the phone, I tend to answer it, however if I am not at the office it is impossible for me to answer it.   Furthermore, I was just released out of the hospital late yesterday.   I was only in for a day, but it was very inconvenient for me to be in the hospital.  \n\nIt is also very inconvenient for me to get your message.  For god's sake, if you called, why didn't you leave a message? Why do you say you've called but I have no record of it on my caller ID? \n\nI already told you that I will not send sensitive private information over the internet in the form of an email.  What am I going to do if some criminal intercepts my email message to you containing all that sensitive data you requested and uses that information to take everything I have?  Furthermore, a while back Nahisa sent me official documents regarding this business and I was impressed and convinced this deal was real.  Your so called official form looks like you typed it up from your imagination.\n\nSo either get that roll of fax paper out of your ass and send me the official paperwork or come up with some other idea of how I will send you sensitive data that DOES NOT USE THE INTERNET.  \n\nFrankly, I don't want to do business with a lawyer who can't afford a fax machine.  I will be advising Mrs. Nasiha that she consider the same.   She will be a very wealthy woman in a very short time and she doesn't need hangers-on like you...\n\nI am copying Mr. Lenner and Mrs. Nasiha on this message. This situation is completely absurd. In all my years, I've never heard of anything like it. \n\nRegards,\n\nHerrel Foggs\n\nP.S.  Barry, if you read this message, we should think about spending all of August in S. Africa and request Nahisa Jameel and her faxless lawyer come visit us. What do you think?  Mrs. Nahisa's description of what it will take to travel to her home sounds quite taxing and her lawyer isn't the sharpest knife in the drawer.  Besides, the Repulsive Pink Enflamed Sperm Garbler winters in S Africa in great numbers, in fact I've heard the entire flock of 400 is down there in August.  We could do some real damage and maybe even send these little critters over the edge toward extinction.  \n\nP.P.S.  Barry, I've recently heard from the airlines we will be using and a customs agent for South Africa.  All we need to do is package our hunting implements and ship them in advance.  I'm sure Hershel will be more than happy to receive these for us.  This way, I don't have to be without my favorite gun and you don't either.  August 1st is only 18 days away and we need to ship the guns by Saturday, July 15 (two days from now) if we want to have them waiting for us.\n\nP.P.P.S. I will be out of town all next week visiting clients and hunting a rare previously thought to be extinct woodpecker in the forests of Arkansas.  Arkansas is about as backwards of a place as a lawyer who doesn't know how to use a fax machine, so I will be almost completely out of touch.  I won't be checking messages or around to receive a fax.  If you somehow discover how to work your fax machine, I'd advise faxing the paperwork to Mr. Lenner in that I won't have time to deal with such details until I get back.  This will speed up the process.  Sorry to stick this with you Barry, but I have no choice, we have to have all these annoying business details wrapped up soon. \n\n\nHerrel S.

Your so called official form looks like you typed it up from your imagination.<br><br>\n\nSo either get that roll of fax paper out of your ass and send me the official paperwork or come up with some other idea of how I will send you sensitive data that DOES NOT USE THE INTERNET.  \n<br><br>\nFrankly, I don't want to do business with a lawyer who can't afford a fax machine.  I will be advising Mrs. Nasiha that she consider the same.   She will be a very wealthy woman in a very short time and she doesn't need hangers-on like you...<br><br>\n\nI am copying Mr. Lenner and Mrs. Nasiha on this message. This situation is completely absurd. In all my years, I've never heard of anything like it. <br><br>\n\nRegards,<br><br>\n\nHerrel Foggs\n<br><br>\nP.S.  Barry, if you read this message, we should think about spending all of August in S. Africa and request Nahisa Jameel and her faxless lawyer come visit us. What do you think?  Mrs. Nahisa's description of what it will take to travel to her home sounds quite taxing and her lawyer isn't the sharpest knife in the drawer.  Besides, the Repulsive Pink Enflamed Sperm Garbler winters in S Africa in great numbers, in fact I've heard the entire flock of 400 is down there in August.  We could do some real damage and maybe even send these little critters over the edge toward extinction.  \n<br><br>\nP.P.S.  Barry, I've recently heard from the airlines we will be using and a customs agent for South Africa.  All we need to do is package our hunting implements and ship them in advance.  I'm sure Hershel will be more than happy to receive these for us.  This way, I don't have to be without my favorite gun and you don't either.  August 1st is only 18 days away and we need to ship the guns by Saturday, July 15 (two days from now) if we want to have them waiting for us.\n<br><br>\nP.P.P.S. I will be out of town all next week visiting clients and hunting a rare previously thought to be extinct woodpecker in the forests of Arkansas.  Arkansas is about as backwards of a place as a lawyer who doesn't know how to use a fax machine, so I will be almost completely out of touch.  I won't be checking messages or around to receive a fax.  If you somehow discover how to work your fax machine, I'd advise faxing the paperwork to Mr. Lenner in that I won't have time to deal with such details until I get back.  This will speed up the process.  Sorry to stick this with you Barry, but I have no choice, we have to have all these annoying business details wrapped up soon. \n\n<br><br>\nHerrel S.
