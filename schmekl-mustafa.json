My wife died after a brief illness that lasted for only two weeks.\n\n\nSince his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home. When my late wife was alive she deposited a huge amount of Money with a bank here BANK OF AFRICA BY NAME. The bank and the management just wrote me as the beneficiary to come forward to sign for the release of this fund or i rather issue a letter of authorization to somebody to receive it on my behalf if I can not come over.\n\n\nPresently, I'm in a hospital in the United Kingdom where I have been undergoing treatment for esophageal cancer. My doctors have told me that I have only a few months to live. It is my last wish to see this money distributed to charity organizations any where in any part of the world of your choice provided the money is used for what I told you. Because relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my illness, I cannot live with the agony of entrusting this huge responsibility to any of them.if you know that you are interested and capable to handle this business transaction, come up with the information's stated below: \n\n\n1. Your full name: \n2. Your contact cell phone number: \n3. Your age: \n4. Your sex: \n5. Your occupations: \n6. Your country and city: \n\n\nPlease, I'm seeking for any honest person who will get the Funds from the bank. And will use this money to fund the poor, orphanages, widows and charity organizations.\n\n\nI took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and I don't want my wife hard earned money to be misused by his greedy relatives. I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going.\n\n\nDue to the state of my health. I don't need any telephone communication .As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the director of the bank with the letter i will give you as he will be the one to assist you in laying claims for this funds. Please contact me through my email for further detail.\n\n\nYours Truly,\nDr Mustafa Kamil\n\nIf you just came in, this is the basic Cancer Patient 'format' (as the scammers call it).
