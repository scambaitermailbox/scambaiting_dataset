I have immediately contacted the auditors in the remittance unit  to confirm this information and they have made it clear to me that this is a serious and very urgent issue and the client involve should comply with (West African Monetary Agency (WAMA) immediately .\n\n\nI have gone through the Stop Order forwarded from the West African Monetary Agency ( WAMA) fund Monitoring Agency, and actually, the news is upsetting.  First, I have to apologize for what ever inconveniences that this will cost you. I have read this note carefully and I understood that we really need to provide the demanded documents or pay the charges for procurement..\n\n\nAs at this very moment, I am not in a good mood since after I read the notice I don't even know how to respond to you to explain the development.  I think my bank management is interested in knowing more about the origin of this funds. I have been in this close door meeting since 8:00am  Ghana local time and the auditors from my head office has just arrived and they have sent there response to West African Monetary Agency ( WAMA)  informing them that they are investigating the funds and  there customer will get back to them soon. This development also affected more than five current transfers of our customers above I Million US Dollar from ICB Ghana.  This has led to a situation where they have also ordered the bank Transfer Unit to  stop every oncoming transaction outside Ghana until all investigations of all current transfers from the bank is concluded. This has also led to inspection of this very fund and they receiving account on your  name over there in Pakistan so you must be very careful and vigilant from this moment.\n\n\nNow that it is clear that we do not have the documents, all I can assure you is that I have done a proper documentation here in my bank. Therefore, you have no problem with the bank. My duty here is to protect your own interest and  I am 100% sure that i have done a perfect job here. You have to understand that this Order is from a West African Monetary Agency ( WAMA) and  I am very worried at this moment because I do not wish to involve myself in  any form of problem with this Agency due my position as the bank staff,  They are working hand in hand with the United Nations Fund Monitoring Agency.\n\n\nYou must be careful at this time, I am advising you to try your possible best to comply with the requirements of the Agency. As an alternative for procuring the documents you have to arrange for the sum of  /USD/$3,579 , I want you to try your best to make this money available from your country even if it mean to take a loan with any interest from any source since the transfer is at the verge of completion. This is because my involvement at this point will raise suspect on me. You can contact the bank at once for advice on how you can make the payment because the bank is in a better position to handle the matter perfectly with the Agency. I am assuring you that as soon as this is accomplished, the suspension of the transferred will be lifted and you have the fund in your account without further delay.\n\n\nYou must have in mind that this is a deal between only the both of us you must not let them investigate the origin of the funds for security reasons. I will advise you to contact the agency and tell them you will need to get back to them and request them to provide you with the information where you will have to transfer the amount .\n\n\nDo whatever  you can do to solve this problem urgently as I am scared because I don't want the government to look into the origin of the fund this will also affect your personality in Pakistan. Please be careful at this time for security reasons try you best to comply urgently.\n\n\nTry and get back to me urgently.\n\n\nRegards,\nJoseph Kwesi Mensah", "raw": "<div id=\"record\">\n\t<div id=\"char\"><span class=\"jm\">JOSEPH KWESI MENSAH</span>\n\t</div>\n\t<div id=\"dialog\" class=\"st\">\n\n<p>\nThis email was received 1/7/10 at 4.15pm\n</p>\n \n<p>\nSubject: ACT FAST\n</p>\n \n<p>\nDear Harry Butkrak ,\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI have just received your email and I have read the  document from the West African Monetary Agency ( WAMA), This is a very serious issue and I want you to know that you are the only person in position to handle this situation at this moment. I have immediately contacted the auditors in the remittance unit  to confirm this information and they have made it clear to me that this is a serious and very urgent issue and the client involve should comply with (West African Monetary Agency (WAMA) immediately .\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI have gone through the Stop Order forwarded from the West African Monetary Agency ( WAMA) fund Monitoring Agency, and actually, the news is upsetting.  First, I have to apologize for what ever inconveniences that this will cost you. I have read this note carefully and I understood that we really need to provide the demanded documents or pay the charges for procurement..\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAs at this very moment, I am not in a good mood since after I read the notice I don't even know how to respond to you to explain the development.  I think my bank management is interested in knowing more about the origin of this funds. I have been in this close door meeting since 8:00am  Ghana local time and the auditors from my head office has just arrived and they have sent there response to West African Monetary Agency ( WAMA)  informing them that they are investigating the funds and  there customer will get back to them soon. This development also affected more than five current transfers of our customers above I Million US Dollar from ICB Ghana.  This has led to a situation where they have also ordered the bank Transfer Unit to  stop every oncoming transaction outside Ghana until all investigations of all current transfers from the bank is concluded. This has also led to inspection of this very fund and they receiving account on your  name over there in Pakistan so you must be very careful and vigilant from this moment.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNow that it is clear that we do not have the documents, all I can assure you is that I have done a proper documentation here in my bank. Therefore, you have no problem with the bank. My duty here is to protect your own interest and  I am 100% sure that i have done a perfect job here. You have to understand that this Order is from a West African Monetary Agency ( WAMA) and  I am very worried at this moment because I do not wish to involve myself in  any form of problem with this Agency due my position as the bank staff,  They are working hand in hand with the United Nations Fund Monitoring Agency.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nYou must be careful at this time, I am advising you to try your possible best to comply with the requirements of the Agency. As an alternative for procuring the documents you have to arrange for the sum of  /USD/$3,579 , I want you to try your best to make this money available from your country even if it mean to take a loan with any interest from any source since the transfer is at the verge of completion. This is because my involvement at this point will raise suspect on me. You can contact the bank at once for advice on how you can make the payment because the bank is in a better position to handle the matter perfectly with the Agency. I am assuring you that as soon as this is accomplished, the suspension of the transferred will be lifted and you have the fund in your account without further delay.\n</p>\n\n\n<p>\nYou must have in mind that this is a deal between only the both of us you must not let them investigate the origin of the funds for security reasons. I will advise you to contact the agency and tell them you will need to get back to them and request them to provide you with the information where you will have to transfer the amount .\n</p>\n\n<p>\nDo whatever  you can do to solve this problem urgently as I am scared because I don't want the government to look into the origin of the fund this will also affect your personality in Pakistan. Please be careful at this time for security reasons try you best to comply urgently.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTry and get back to me urgently.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nRegards,<br />\nJoseph Kwesi Mensah\n</p>\n\n </div>\n</div>\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "", "author_role": "bait", "body": "Dear Mr Owusu\n\n\nThank you I did receive the notice from WAMA.
