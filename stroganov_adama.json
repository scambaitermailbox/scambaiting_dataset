I am very happy that you have sent the application to the bank. Please what we have to do now is to pray for the bank to answer us.<br><br>\nPlease ready this careful<br><br>\n\nPlease always remember to keep this transaction as a top secret and you should not reply to any mail received from the bank until  I guide you on what to do as to avoid any mistakes.<br><br>\n\nAlso don't reply any business proposal from here or outside this country. When you receive any emails similar to my first message to you, please don't reply to it because sometimes it may come from this Banks monitoring unit.<br><br>\n\nThey may try you by sending a proposal as to know whether it is somebody from here proposed the business to you. if you reply to any mail like that means we will loose the fund. just  get in touch with me before replying any mail, so that I will guide you on what to do.<br><br>\n\nEven sometimes they may send you thesame proposal with differed names and differed amount to see whether you will reply to them so they will know that you are not the next of kin to the deceased customer. and this will make us to lose the fund.\n<br><br>\nThis is for the fact that this fund has been dormant for years without any person coming for it. I hoped that you will not betray me when this fund enters your account. I put all my hope and  trust in you, and since this transaction is between us i take you as my own bloodily brother.<br><br>\n\nBest regards and hoping to see you after this deal.<br><br>\n\n   Mr Ali Adama.\n\n\n\n</span><br><br>\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "", "author_role": "bait", "body": "Aug 17\n\nADAMA\n\nTHIS IS ALL VERY WELL AND WHILST I TRUST YOU TO A\nDEGREE IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THESE MEANDERING\nMODALITIES ARE NOT 100% RISK-FREE OR TOTALLY LEGAL_BE\nHONEST WITH ME MAN_REMEMBER I WAS IN THE KBG SO I CAN\nUNDERSTAND A FEW SHADY DEALINGS IN THE NAME OF THE\nGREATER GOOD_GET BACK TO ME IMMEDIATELY_YOU MAY FIND\nTHERE IS A SLIGHT DELAY IN GETTING BACK TO YOU OVER\nTHE NEXT DAY OR SO AS I AM OPENING A NEW CUSTARD\nFACTORY IN NOOGIE CITY OVER IN LATIVA_YOU WILL HAVE TO\nBEAR WITH ME\n\nS", "raw": "<hr><span class=\"ms\">MIKHAIL STROGANOV</span><br><br>\n<span class=\"ast\">\n\n\n\nAug 17<br><br>\n\nADAMA<br><br>\n\nTHIS IS ALL VERY WELL AND WHILST I TRUST YOU TO A\nDEGREE IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THESE MEANDERING\nMODALITIES ARE NOT 100% RISK-FREE OR TOTALLY LEGAL_BE\nHONEST WITH ME MAN_REMEMBER I WAS IN THE KBG SO I CAN\nUNDERSTAND A FEW SHADY DEALINGS IN THE NAME OF THE\nGREATER GOOD_GET BACK TO ME IMMEDIATELY_YOU MAY FIND\nTHERE IS A SLIGHT DELAY IN GETTING BACK TO YOU OVER\nTHE NEXT DAY OR SO AS I AM OPENING A NEW CUSTARD\nFACTORY IN NOOGIE CITY OVER IN LATIVA_YOU WILL HAVE TO\nBEAR WITH ME<br><br>\n\nS\n\n</span><br><br>\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "", "author_role": "scam", "body": "DATE:18-08-2005. \nATTN:MR.MIKHAIL ILICHY ROMAN STROGANOV. \n\n\nSIR, \n\nWE WISH TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE RECEIPT OF YOUR FORWARDED\nAPPLICATION LETTER DATED 17th AUG 2005 AND THE\nCONTENTS ARE WELL UNDERSTOOD.\n\nWE ALSO WANT TO BRING TO YOUR NOTICE THAT THE BEQUITED\nLEGACY OF MR CHRISTIAN EICH IS IN OUR CUSTODY. \n\nTHE SAID MAN WAS OUR CUSTOMER FOR SIXTEEN YEARS BEFORE\nHIS DEATH.WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR HIS NEXT OF KIN TO\nCOME FORWARD FOR HIS BALANCE LEFT IN OUR BANK. \n\nWE WILL GET BACK TO YOU SOONEST AFTER THE BOARD OF\nDIRECTORS MEETING IN RESPECT OF YOUR APPLICATION. \n\nYOUR FAITHFULLY, \n\nDR ALI ABOUBAKAR.\n\nDIRECTOR FOREIGN REMMITTANCE DEPT.
