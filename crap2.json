I trust you will be able to meet him at the airport and\ntransport him in the style to which he is accustomed.\n \nThere is one small matter that is most urgent. The Concorde needs a long\nrunway, so Lord Henry needs you to find out how long the runway is at\nthe Athens airport. Perhaps you could ring them and find out. If they\nwont tell you, perhaps you could walk along the road next to the\nairport and measure it in feet. If you can also give us your shoe size\nwe can work out if the runway is long enough. \n\nYou see, if the runway is too short the plane will go off the end and\ncrash!\n \nI have attached a photograph of myself. \n\nBest of luck. \n\nProfessor Billy Rubin \nAustralia \n\n\n\n\n[]", "From the desk of Lord Henry Thompson Fotheringham-Smythe Esq  CMG GCMG BSC SSC \nField Operations \nThe Center for Research into Advanced Pharmaceuticals \n\n[] \n\n\n\n\n\n[]\n\n\n\n24th March, 2004 \n\nMy Dear Mr James Kabila, \n\nI will be concluding this transaction in Athens, and I look forward to\nseeing you soon.\n \nProfessor Billy Rubin has told me all about you. \n\n1) I look forward to concluding this business transaction soon. You did\nnot say if I would need any money for unexpected expenses, but I have\nbrought some anyway.\n2) I attach a photograph of myself so you will recognise me at the\nairport.\n3) Will you be meeting me yourself at the airport?\n4) I do need to know the length of the runway at the airport. This is\nmost important, because we have had problems where runways have been too\nshort, and we have bumped the nose of the Concorde plane at the end of\nthe runway. It takes ages to hammer the nose back into the proper shape.\nDo let me know the length of the runway as soon as possible, theres a\ngood chap.\n5) I will be arriving at exactly 9:18pm on Friday. I look forward to\nmeeting you and your wonderful mother.\n\nYours in friendship,\n\nLord Henry", "From Dame Edna Everage to James Kabila\n\nHello there my shy little possum!\n\nIve heard that you want to be the father of my babies. Im so excited!!\n\nDont tell Lord Henry, but Ive stowed away on his Concorde. That means Ill be meeting you in person on Friday.\n\nI dont want to rush you, but when we get married, do you prefer pink or a milder shade of purple for the wedding outfits? And what about the flowers in the church?\n\nIve attached a photo of me from a few years back.\n\nIll see you soon. \n\nAll my love  xxx, \n\nEdna\n\n\n\n\n\n[]"], "messages": [{"from_name": "James Mobi Kabila.

I write this letter in respect of my intention to invest the sum of US$35M(Thirty Five Million United State Dollars) with you. I inherited this money from my mother. This money was got through the sales of Diamond and Timber when my father was the head of state. My mother though not her legal wife used her privilege position to engage in the business of Diamond and Timber since she knows that her survival will depend on how much she can get out of the privilege situation.When my father was assassinated on 16TH Jan. 01 by one of his bodyguards Lt.Rashidi Kasereke through the conspiracy of some top army officers that wanted to topple him I escaped to Athens-Greece because of the fear that I might be arrested by my half brother Lt. General Joseph Kabila the present head of state. Actually his mother and my mother are not in the best of relationship because of who among them will be the first lady tussle and this ultimately affected us their children. Considering the relationship between Athens-Greece and the Democratic Republic of Congo Government, my mother advised me to leave for Athens-Greece for security reason, while the funds were deposited with a Security Company in Athens-Greece. On getting to Athens-Greece where I have been living since then as a political refugee I am seeking for a reliable foreigner who can assist me in moving this money out for safe banking and profitable investment. Honestly I contacted you because I don't want to invest this money in Athens-Greece due to my status here as a political Refugee. And moreover I wouldn't want to take risk because this money is all that I and my Mother is depending on because My half brother has seized all my father's assets and money and left I and my mother empty handed without knowing about this funds deposited at the Security Company in Athens-Greece so that is why I decided that investing this money abroad should be the best investment for me. I will be honored if I can be given the privilege of investing this money with your help.In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this distress call to save my mother and I from a hopeless future.

Thereafter, the term shall be varied. 5% for expenses which may arise during the transaction.
