It may strike you strange that someone in the T.P.\nindustry would be interested in a Dam, but before I founded T.P. Industries, I\nwas in the Dam industry. In fact, I graduated Magna Cum Laudly with a\nmechanical engineering degree and a minor in Dam infrastructure. Once I began\nworking in the Dam industry, I started to specialize in troubleshooting\nproblems associated with Sub-structural Corrosive Articulated Miosis (known as\nS.C.A.M. to Dam engineers). You see, S.C.A.M. is a big problem in the Dam\nindustry. S.C.A.M. plagues the turbine generators of modern hydro-electric\nDams, causing the financial loss of millions of dollars each year. I developed\na\n proprietary process to block S.C.A.M. from damaging these systems, and my\npatented Anti-S.C.A.M. product has pretty much become the industry standard.\nThrough my process, Dam workers around the world are able to avoid the\nmoney-loss related to the various types of S.C.A.M. To this day, I am very\npassionate about the Dam industry, and am an active member of the British Dam\nSociety (www.britishdams.org). I hope to present a white paper on Anti-S.C.A.M.\nin the near future.\n\n \n\nDo you have any contacts in the Dam industry in your area? Any Dam contacts you\ncould provide would be greatly appreciated. Although much of my time these days\nis spent rolling my T.P. out, I still enjoy the occasional opportunity to serve\nas a Dam Anti-S.C.A.M. consultant. I have realized much enjoyment thanks to my\nAnti-S.C.A.M. activities.\n\n \n\nI almost forgot the main reason I am e-mailing you again. I have a quick\nquestion for you. You mention payment of back taxes in your past e-mail. Please\nlet me know how much this would involve. If it is a large sum, I need to start\ntapping some of my different resources so as not to raise any red flags.

Tomorrow, I get to spend the day visiting the\nPoilao Dam site in Cabo Verde. I will talk to some of the Dam workers. If I\nhave a little time left over after my Dam visit, I will see if I can find a Dam\nsouvenir to take home. It may strike you strange that someone in the T.P.\nindustry would be interested in a Dam, but before I founded T.P. Industries, I\nwas in the Dam industry. In fact, I graduated Magna Cum Laudly with a\nmechanical engineering degree and a minor in Dam infrastructure. Once I began\nworking in the Dam industry, I started to specialize in troubleshooting\nproblems associated with Sub-structural Corrosive Articulated Miosis (known as\nS.C.A.M. to Dam engineers). You see, S.C.A.M. is a big problem in the Dam\nindustry. S.C.A.M. plagues the turbine generators of modern hydro-electric\nDams, causing the financial loss of millions of dollars each year. I developed\na\n proprietary process to block S.C.A.M. from damaging these systems, and my\npatented Anti-S.C.A.M. product has pretty much become the industry standard.\nThrough my process, Dam workers around the world are able to avoid the\nmoney-loss related to the various types of S.C.A.M. To this day, I am very\npassionate about the Dam industry, and am an active member of the British Dam\nSociety (www.britishdams.org). I hope to present a white paper on Anti-S.C.A.M.\nin the near future.\n<br><br>\n \n\nDo you have any contacts in the Dam industry in your area? Any Dam contacts you\ncould provide would be greatly appreciated. Although much of my time these days\nis spent rolling my T.P. out, I still enjoy the occasional opportunity to serve\nas a Dam Anti-S.C.A.M. consultant. I have realized much enjoyment thanks to my\nAnti-S.C.A.M. activities.\n<br><br>\n \n\nI almost forgot the main reason I am e-mailing you again. I have a quick\nquestion for you. You mention payment of back taxes in your past e-mail. Please\nlet me know how much this would involve. If it is a large sum, I need to start\ntapping some of my different resources so as not to raise any red flags. The\nsooner I can start on this, the sooner we can wrap this up.\n<br><br>\n \n\nLook forward to hearing from you.\n\n <br><br>\n\nYour amigo,<br><br>\n\n \n\nBeavis Bungholio(Creator of the best Dam Anti-S.C.A.M.!)<br>\n\nPresident, T.P.
