For the past fifteen years, my work has been with whores. Exclusively with whores.\n \nI have a calling to attend to the spiritual needs of our fallen sisters. Every night, I get into my 1979 Cadillac Coupe de Ville and cruise the alleys and back streets of Omaha, Idaho, searching for whores. My work has been to reveal to these poor, misguided women of the evening the straight and rigid True Way. Upon seeing it, they fall to their knees, bob their heads in prayer, and accept fully and without reservation the True Way.\n \nYou cannot imagine the amount of women I have saved from the ways of the Devil merely by revealing the True Way. It is a calling that allows me to stand erect in the Light of Revelation. They then abandon their former evil ways and join my ever-expanding flock, spreading the Good News far and wide.\n \nAs you can imagine, the financial burden upon my ministry is great, so your kind offer of $7 million seemed like a miracle to me. And although I weep to think of your breasts being disfigured by cancer, I rejoice in the chance that your untimely and tragic death will give me to continue my holy calling with the whores.\n \nYour kindness could not have come at a better time. Although we are having a warm summer, it promises to be a difficult winter. There is an extra thick growth of fur on the north side of the whores already, and my trusty Farmer's Almanack says that this is an infallible sign of many months of rough weather. Many, many whores would have frozen to death this winter without your kindness.\n \nYour story is very interesting to me. Your name is Debra Wealth? How clever! You have wealth, and your name is Wealth. Isn't God great?!? And you are the widow of the late Sheikh Wealth? Was he any relation to the well-known Wealth family of Upper Waukepetonsett Falls, the wealthy textile tycoons? I was at one point well-acquainted with old man Erasmus Wealth, and his wife, Mrs. Prudence Wealth. Lovely people. Strict Congregationalists.\n \nAh, but wait. Your late husband was a Sheikh. I once met a rich Arabian who was also a Sheikh. He was a member of the al-Ratlan-roh-El family. We referred to him as Sheikh Ratlan-Roh-El. He had made millions in importing halal dairy products to Mecca--he was something of a milk Sheikh.\n \nAm I to imply that you were born into Islam, and have seen the straight and rigid True Way as well? You may be interested to know that one of my clerical colleagues here in Omaha, Idaho is the Imam of the Local Mosque, Imam Rodney Washington El-Shabazz X. He is also passionately committed to the cause of ministering to whores, and joins me frequently on my missions.\n \nAll right, enough with the small talk. There's whores what need a-savin.'
