George</span><br><br><span class=\"st\">\n\nEliza,<br>\nThanks for your emails of Monday and Tuesday. Sorry that I am writing you this response after a couple of days.It is has been quite a busy period for us too. It was nice to read of your interest in botanical scinences.It does not matter if your friends and folks listen when you talk to them about improving GM.The world needs you and I want to encourage you not to let anything be a distraction to your aspirations in this direction.In fact,if we do succeed together,I will personally apportion part of my own share to research in genetical sciences and the modification of living species of all sorts with a goal to make better grades of such species. I have understood that I cannot call you on telephone.It is also interesting to know that you are 22.I am 40,so there is a wide 18 years betwen us.<br>\n Concerning the issue of a non-resident investment bank account,please be informed that this is ok and the possible way out for us. The details is as follows:We here work out a strategy for you to receive the pay out of the funds in either Switzerland,Amsterdam-Netherlands or Accra,Ghana(West Africa)through one of the  bank's affiliate financial institions.Be reassured that this can be achieved. When you arrive there,you will open a non-resident investment bank account in your own name and lodge the funds which I will ensure will be paid out to you in cash or a cash equivalent banking instrument such as a confirmable Bank Draft,into the account. You could either decide to leave the funds in this account as invesment funds of from this account,you send out little transfers piecemeal and unnoticed,to any other bank accounts you might open elsewhere in the world. Please let us know what you decide so that we could start off the transaction in earnest.<br>\nSincere regards,<br>\nFrank O George Esq.\n\n</span><br><br>\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "", "author_role": "bait", "body": "What else could go wrong?

The foreign banking idea is neat, but it has a problem - I don't have a passport. Given the way things have tightened up, it could take a while to get one. \nThen I have to think up a plausible reason to travel - and I've never talked to my folks about going to Africa, so Ghana's out. Amsterdam would make more sense... but then there's the fact that Nick (remember - my boyfriend?) would insist on coming along, and he'd wonder why I was going to some investment bank and not an art gallery or something...

Please I have already tendered my sincere apologies. I do not mean or intend any harm. I hope you will accept my pleading. However, whatever is your position in furthering your assistance in this venture, will be fully acceptable and respected. But what I will not accept is you having bad blood against me and consequently getting the whole transaction scuttled. <br>\nPlease in whatever action you would wish to take, whether withdrawing your assistance or not, never let the bank (Mr. Jimmy Clark) have any reason to suspect that this fund is ill gotten. Let none of your contact with him be negative or pose hindrance in recovering the fund. Frankly speaking, this fund originated from here, in one of our local banks. We have the intention to approaching the recovery of the money through another means.
