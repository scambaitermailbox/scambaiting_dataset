I just can't believe my luck in receiving yet another rare opportunity to gain a huge fortune for doing squat. As with my other benefactors Anton, I should really insist on paying you a hefty handler's fee for brokering such an unbelievable deal.\n<br><br>\nIT MUST BE SECRET. Can I pay you this in cash as to not leave a paper trail back to my winnings? The Government would surely want to tax the Hell (sorry for the devil reference Reverend Kalaku) out of my winnings. \n <br><br>\nMaybe after receiving this cool 1.5 mil, I could then entice the lovely\nLinda Tega to finally go on a camping trip with me. I could take her first class and give it to her 'in the Winnebago' if you know what I mean ;). I would not normally go for multiple business opportunities of such high gain and low personal risk but how can I say \"No\" to a former gold medallist in judo? I mean even if he is over 60 years old (and probably dead) he could still throw me on my head. Don't let the Japanese know I've won this prize Anton, as they are still mad about losing that gold medal (not to mention the War).<br><br>\n \nWell I must be off now to get that cash out of the bank so I can finally\nsee my winnings appear. I can't wait to see the faces of all the naysayers when I pull in my windfall.

My name is Aadrew Williams, a merchant in U.K. I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer . It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone(not even myself)but my business.\n\nThough I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world,I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends. I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so I have decided to give also to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organizations in Asia and U.K, they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not \ntrust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of twenty five million dollars $25,000,000.00 that I have with a finance institution in Europe. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatche it to charity organizations. I have set aside 20% for you and some expences that may incure during the proccess of these transaction. God be with you. Please reach me through my personal email address of: andrewwillams@walla.com  remember to keep this known to yourself alone and I for now,as I am doing this as a contribution to life on earth. I will also appreciate if you provide me with your contact mobile and home phone numbers, so that i can forward them to a reputable lawyer who would put you through the whole process.

My name is Aadrew Williams, a merchant in U.K. I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer . It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone(not even myself)but my business.<br><br>\n\nThough I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world,I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends. I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so I have decided to give also to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organizations in Asia and U.K, they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not \ntrust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of twenty five million dollars $25,000,000.00 that I have with a finance institution in Europe. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatche it to charity organizations. I have set aside 20% for you and some expences that may incure during the proccess of these transaction. God be with you.
