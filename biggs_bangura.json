This does not change the security of your situation. You\nare 100% safe and you will get your money.\n\nTo clarify the Don Biggs mix-up, \"Don\" is a title like Mr. It is said\nrespectfully Roger Biggs is \"Don Biggs\" as he is the head of the\nfamily.

It would have been a great disrespect not to\nand would have annoyed him greatly. By the way, a word of warning -\nnever NEVER misspell Roger as \"RoGGer\" with two Gs when you write to\nhim.
