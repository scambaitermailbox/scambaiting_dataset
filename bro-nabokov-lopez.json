This scam (yes, it is a scam) works like so:<br />\nThe victim is exhorted to send some amount, in this case $110, to pay the 'processing' fee on an imaginary Golden Metal Box (or whatever). There is no Golden Metal Box. The Box doesn't exist. It's not pining for the fjords. It's not even dead. It's Imaginary.<br />\nAnd now back to the scam:\n</p>\n\n\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "2014-04-25 00:00", "subject": "", "author_role": "bait", "body": "I have sent the money you requested in a canvas bag.
