We turn off the computers over the weekend, so that we will have no \"modern annoyances\" to bother us. You should try it--a great way to keep family connections and return to easier and gentler times. It does a lot to keep the stress-level down, and it is so nice and peaceful-- we don't even watch TV! \n<br><br>\nOn Saturdays and Sundays, we go on picnics, take long walks, we read books, and have wonderful conversations. (And of course, I do  you-know-what with my amazing wife Patty!) <br><br> I am having the worst time with your telephone system. It stinks, and it doesn't work! I checked with the phone company, and they tell me that long distance charges to your number would cost me about $4/minute, which I am loath to pay. Money doesn't grow on trees, you know! So for the nonce, we will continue corresponding through email, as I said last week, details are easier to keep straight, if you can see them written down. \n<br><br>\n\nHope this is OK. Don't forget, don't write on the weekends, I won't see the mails until Monday morning. \n<br><br>\n\nThanks, C.

Really, only $18 million dollars!, just a trivial amount. My own inheritance will be more than 10 times that, and I will live on a very generous trust fund until my parents die, so I have no desire to pursue your little endeavor.

I am barely able to get through the day, but at least I don't cry all day long. When Chuck was murdered, I thought my life had come to an end, too.  Little did I know the comfort and support given to me by Hugh would sustain me so well, he has truly been a mountain of strength for me. I just marvel at the man's continuous ministrations to me! <br><br> As Hugh probably told you, he has moved into my home to be near me, just in case I need him--which turns out to be many times throughout the day and night--he has really helped me get through this trying time.
