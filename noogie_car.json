even know them.<br><br>\n\nplease your case with some others are strictly being handled by my very self due to the sensitivity in it.Hencefort, caution them from sending you mails or if they by any means send without your consent please do not reply to them rather forward it to me so that i can aswell fish them out over here with that information.<br><br>\n\nLike i told you this morning my boys have been able to take the photograph of that house and it has been sent to me i would have loved to send it to you now but there was an outbreak some where in the town so my attention is higherly needed over there,therefore,i will send the photogragh to you as soon as am back from there so that you will see where people who claim to be governors and presidents collecting money from you are staying.<br><br>\n\nI really do not know how you people easily get carried away by this ediots who could not even speak good english</span> <span class=\"lnc\">[Yeah, right...] </span><span

suspicious minds., Am very much afraid at this point because when you indicated your interest in working with me i told mr Hamza to go ahead to book you on the ground that both the $2300 and the $300 will be coming together which actully prompted my making that deposit , therefore that left your account to be having some balance to pay and if you do not pay that balance my dear am very much afraid on how i can get back my money  i must be sincere to you.Had it been it would be that easy for sure i would have loved to do that for you atleaset it is your money aswell.\n\n<br><br>\n\nMr lewis assist me and assist your self, I know things are not very easy but if you can just try and effect that payment so that my money will not be a waste atleast i worked for it i will be so grateful. .Try
