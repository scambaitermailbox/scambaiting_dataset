Because of this, sometimes \n              we are approached by dishonest people who try to get money from \n              us by deception, sometimes supplying false identification.</p>\n            <p>Because of the possibility of people sending false identification, \n              the church now insists that any prospective recipient of our funds \n              MUST supply a new photograph of themselves (or a representative) \n              posing with two icons of our church, in this case BREAD and WINE \n              (as you know, the name of our church is The Church of Bread &amp; \n              Wine). </p>\n            <p>The reason we ask you to pose with these two object is of course \n              because some dishonest people may try to send in false pictures, \n              but it would be almost impossible for someone to find a false picture \n              of a person holding bread and wine together in a photograph.</p>\n            <p>One receipt of your photograph showing yourself (or a representative) \n              holding these objects, we will be 100% sure that the photograph \n              is genuine, this will then facilitate the SPEEDY payment of the \n              donation. Note that until you have completed the agreement, do not \n              send in the photograph until we have explained how the church would \n              like you to hold the bread and wine.<br>\n              In every photograph we ask for, we always ask for a different poses, \n              just to make certain that the picture is unique.</p>\n            <p>I have attached the agreement form for you Rev. Tokunbo Please \n              complete the form and return it to me with your signature.

Tokunboh,</p>\n            <p>My apologies over the late reply but I must tell you there has \n              been some disturbing news.</p>\n            <p>Three days ago, the church received an email from a Dr. David Mbeke, \n              claiming to be a representative of The Widows In Nigeria asking \n              for a donation ( thewidowsinnigeria@yahoo.co.uk ) Of course, I was \n              shocked to receive such an email and so as I have done with you, \n              I asked him to provide proof of his identity by sending me a photograph \n              of himself featuring Bread &amp; Wine. </p>\n            <p>Today a photograph has arrived (I have attached a copy for you) \n              and I have to say that I am very confused because the image seems \n              to me to me genuine. Do you have other people besides yourself working \n              for the Widows In Nigeria Rev. Tokunboh?
