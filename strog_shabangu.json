However strange or surprising this contact might seem to you as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past, I humbly ask that you take due consideration of its importance and the immense benefit it will be to you.\n\nAfter careful consideration with my children, we resolved to contact you for your most needed assistance in this manner. I duly apologize for infringing on your privacy, if this contact is not acceptable to you, as I make this proposal to you as a person of integrity.  \n\nFirst and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is Mrs. Susan Shabangu, mother of three and the Deputy Minister of Minerals and Energy of The Republic of South Africa for seven years running You may view my profile on the following link; http://www.gov.za/profiles/shabangu.htm   \n\nI will now give you a general overview of the situation.\n\nWhen I was sworn in as Deputy Minister of Minerals and Energy in 1996, with my influence, my husband Mr. Ndelebe Shabangu a very successful businessman was awarded several contracts in my ministry and had direct dealings with foreign investors in this field. Due to my political status, I was not involved in my husband\u00d5s business which was very vast and successful. My beloved husband died whilst on an official trip to Trinidad and Tobago in February 2001. \n\nWhen my husband died, I was contacted as next of kin by a private security firm in Europe to come forth with the Certificate of Deposit and claim a safety deposit my husband has in their Vault in his name. At that time, my children and I did not have an idea where the Certificate might be. We then instructed the security firm to continue holding the safety deposit until further instructions from me. Whilst preparing for the second remembrance of my beloved husband, I was going through his library collection and to my astonishment I discovered a Certificate of Deposit for the safety deposit with this private security firm, and other documents relating to the safety deposit in a book. The safety deposit which is a trunk, is stocked with hard currency (US Dollars) totalling $18,500,000 which was generated from cash payments from his business associates in the diamond trade from Antwerp, Belgium. \n\nThough I knew my late husband was in the diamond business, I did not have the knowledge that he moved funds in cash. This has came as a shock to me and my children, and we have decided to have this fund invested immediately, as any member of my family cannot hold such a huge amount in our name due to my political status, hence we sincerely propose to you to render us your most needed assistance in this regard. \n\nIf you accept to render us your assistance, your role in this project will be to act on my behalf as a trustee to receive the funds in your Country for immediate investments commercial and residential properties abroad as well as profitable ventures. Though I believe this transaction should be based on mutuality, my family\u00d5s interest will be protected by a family associate, who is an lawyer attached to the South African Embassy in the country where the security firm is located. He is now aware of the safety deposit, and will assist in making arrangements for release of the safety deposit, and transfer of the funds. I have informed him that I am locating one of my husband\u00d5s business associates (you) to handle the funds and invest on our behalf, as he might be opposed to my decision to have you as a business partner if he found out that I barely know you.\n\nFor your reliable assistance, we are offering you 15 %($2,775,000) of the funds. \n\nI thank you in advance as we anticipate your assistance in enabling us achieve this goal. On hearing from you, I will forward your contact to the gentleman lawyer who will be representing us, and also give you his contact for both of you to communicate and proceed with the transaction. He will be working with you for a mutual conclusion of the process and I look forward to a long lasting business relationship with you. As you may understand, due to my sensitive position in the present government, it is not safe to communicate with me via phone or fax. This is why I have communicated with you with my private email address, and I like us to keep this way, for the safety of this transaction. \n\nPlease contact me on my private email address; shabangus56@netscape.net whether or not you are interested in assisting us. This will enable us make alternative plans, in the event of non-interest on your part. \n\nWith warm regards, \nMrs. S.
