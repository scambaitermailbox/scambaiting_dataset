Your email has been read and \n              understood, but you seem to have neglected to provide me some proof \n              that your intentions are indeed honourable. Here in my part of the \n              country, we like to come face to face with people who we are having \n              serious business dealings with (and most of the time have a good \n              booze-up). Are you able to fly over here to the UK to meet with \n              me sweetie? I am able to fly out to you, but to my great sadness \n              this will not be possible for some time yet as my business needs \n              me here and now. I would very much like to see the face of the person \n              I am dealing with, and it would also set my mind at ease that I \n              am dealing with an honourable man. Would it be possible for you \n              to email me a photograph of yourself? I will be happy to send you \n              my picture as I of course understand that trust works both ways.</p>\n            <p>Your acceptance of my terms will go a long way to ensure our business \n              dealing will be a happy one. I am hoping that my business commitments \n              will be over within a week or so, and at that time I will be free \n              to either greet you in my country, or perhaps maybe I can fly out \n              and meet with you at a location we are both agreeable to. Pardon \n              my ignorance (my geography is not too good) but is Nigeria anywhere \n              near Disneyland? If it is, that would be great.
