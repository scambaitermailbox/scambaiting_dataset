Do you still have the trunk safely stored? The hospital Board have provisionally agreed to release the funds itemized in your previous invoice, but this is dependent on one of the board members meeting you in person in order to ensure your bona fides, as I mentioned earlier. I gather you're based in London - is that correct? If so, I believe it will be possible for such a meeting to take place soon. Please confirm your receipt of this message, and your location, and I will elaborate.<br /><br />\n\nRegards<br />\n\nSweeney H. Todd, M.

However, before paying you the required fees for delivery of the trunk, and discussing the additional business I mentioned earlier, they would like to have one of the board members meet face-to-face with you. Fortunately, your reply is well-timed: one of the board members (most likely either Dr. Clauberg or Dr. Mengele, dependent on surgical schedule) will be traveling to London this Friday morning on United Airlines Flight 0930, arriving from San Francisco at London Heathrow at 7.10 am this Friday, September 8th. On successfully meeting you and confirming your bona fides, the board member will be instructed to immediately arrange to wire funds to you to pay for delivery of the trunk. Because of the sensitive nature of the additional business, please print and hold the sign that I've attached - note that it identifies neither you nor any of the board members by name, but I assure you that whichever doctor is traveling on Friday will recognize the sign immediately.

You have already given me an estimate for the delivery charges; I have sent you documentation that you agreed was acceptable proving that I am the legal recipient of the trunk. The board of Little Boys Hospital has agreed to pay the shipping charges, but because a considerable sum is involved, they would like to have one of their representatives meet with you in person before payment is made. Once this meeting has taken place, the money you requested will be immediately wired to you, and you may then proceed to ship the trunk to me as we originally agreed. One of our board is currently in the air headed for Heathrow, but I presume it's somewhat late for you to meet him by now. Hence I will have to let you know next time one of the hospital board travels to London, and I hope you will be able to rendezvous with him then. I apologize for the inconvenience, but given the amount of funds requested (almost 20,000 US dollars at the current exchange rate), I'm sure you can understand that the Hospital would like a face-to-face meeting to confirm your bona fides before payment is made. Obviously it's impractical for me to come over there and \"pick up\" the trunk box: it's too large to take as luggage on a commercial flight, hence the necessity of employing a shipping company to deliver it.\n\nRegards\n\nSweeney H.
