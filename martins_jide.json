{"notes": ["Martins Jide plays email Russian Roulette, and unfortunately gets the Cyberspace equivilent of a bullet in the side of the head. His email lands in my inbox, a mistake that will cost this particular scammer $718", "OK I have to explain a few things here. I have had to exclude a few days of correspondence for security purposes. The reason for the self censorship is that the techniques used in this particular scambait need to be kept out of the way of prying eyes (scammers will be watching!). The routine is similar to the one that I used in the Frank Kabongo bait, Scamming On The Telephone but with newer more 'convincing' operations added. The technique uses some new ideas from myself, and also ideas that other fellow baiters are using.", "To openly publish this particular correspondence in full would jeopardize both myself and my fellow scambaiter's future efforts against these people. Of course the art of scambaiting can be very humorous, but at the same time it is a very serious business, and we do not want to educate these thieves in our various tactics.", "Apologies to my readers, but the full correspondence will be published when it's safe to do so!", "We take up the story a few days later. I have convinced Martins that I have already sent money to another scammer. Martins thinks that I have contacted him by mistake, thinking he is my original scammer, but soon he is in for a big let-down. In the process, Martins is made to change his name from Martins Jide to Martins Jude (he thinks this is the name of my original scammer). He believes I have $77,250 to transfer to him, but before he receives that there is the small matter of my guarantee fee!", "Martins calls me to try to convince me to put my money into a fake online bank.", "[Surprisingly, Martins seems to have sent the guarantee fee, but he seems to have sent \u00a3400 (about $718 USD) instead!]", "[Better double check that the amount Martins has sent is correct]", "[Looks like it is correct. This is great. Ask for some money, then get a bonus amount added for no extra effort!]", "Success! The Western Union payment has now been received, all \u00a3400 ($718) of it! Now I will do what I do best and make my pet sweat by not replying to his emails for the next few days! In the meantime, feast your eyes on the prize below (details censored to protect my innocence!)", "The money has already been donated to a worthy charity.", "[It's the day after I withdrew the payment, and Martins seems worried]", "[I'll turn the screw a little more by getting my secretary to give Martins something more to worry about]", "[Martins sends a desperate email to Marcus]", "[Sucess for Martins. Gladys decides to reply with some good news]", "Martins calls and needs to know why I haven't spoken to him recently.", "Martins calls again, just as I am outside the Western Union office about to make his payment (or so he thinks!)", "WARNING: TRAGEDY ALERT!", "Martins sends me a few \"Where are you?\" emails over the next few days, which I ignore (I'm dead after all). He eventually sends Gladys an email to try to find out what is going on", "Gladys has some bad news for Martins.", "Because of certain security issues, I can't publish the last few exchanges between myself and Martins, however what I can tell you is that eventually he twigged that I had been baiting him. He sent me a couple of threats, and I replied with threats of my own (too unsavoury to publish here!). Needless to say, this particular bait was over by October 28.", "OK, a few weeks later, and after giving Martins time to cool off, I decided to give him a call. Martins is actually located in London, which is a really cheap telephone call for me. Of course, I did not call him as Marcus DeWitt, I pretended I was some other victim. I didn't have any pre-prepared plan on what I was going to say to him, I just wanted to know how he would react from receiving a call at 2:20 in the morning!", "Apologies to Irish visitors for the abysmal Irish accent I put on. I didn't want Martins to recognise my voice!", "As promised, I give Martins a call the next day. Trouble is I was ungracious enough to ring him at 3AM this time!", "This time I decided to see if he would notice me deliberately slipping into a US and a slightly deep south US accent! I really need lots of practice with my voices I'm afraid. I'll probably stick to British ones, and perhaps try a Prince Charles one soon!", "Anyway, Martins got frustrated with me and put the phone down. I called him again and chucked a few 4X words at him, which I have edited out so as not to cause too much offence to anyone! See if you can spot where they were!", "The third and final time I rang him back it sounded like he picked up the phone and put it under his pillow. Though the recording goes off after a few minutes, I did hang on for another ten minutes or so, whistling down the phone!", "Looks like it's game over.", "Feeling sorry for Martins? DON'T! Martins makes a career out of stealing money from people on a daily basis. Like most other scammers he has absolutely no compassion or feelings of guilt, and more than likely he would cut your throat for a few dollars if you were ever foolish enough to bump into him on his own turf. Martins can be thankful that all he lost was \u00a3400, this is mere pocket change compared to the many many thousands of pounds he steals every year from innocent victims."], "messages": [{"body": "It is obvious that this proposal will come to you as a\nsuprise.
