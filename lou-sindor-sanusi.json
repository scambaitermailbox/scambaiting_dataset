Due to privacy issues associated\nwith the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978, the bank cannot supply any\nfurther details about the account, the investigation (if there is one) or\nthe account's activity until given written authorization on our behalf from\nthe account owner. This, as you might imagine, will be made moot once I\nspeak to said owner and we get this matter straightened out.<br /><br />\nI have no need to speak with you at this time, sir and, as my time is\nbilled hourly to Mr. Sindor, and thus have no need to supply you with a\nphone number. At such time as that becomes necessary, I will gladly do so.<br />\nI do, of course, need to be cognizant of my client's planned expenses in\nthe pursuit of this matter.
