You could lose millions!

I would think that knowing this would make you pleased that you were dealing with someone of integrity instead of making you suspicious.\n\nHere's what I'll do - you send me your HIV certificate tomorrow so I can get it to Boris and we'll know that your visa is in progress. Once I receive it, I will contact the manager of my bank and tell him to go ahead and pay the bank in Amsterdam. I will contact the bank in Amsterdam and tell them to hold the transfer to my account until you have your airline tickets in hand.
