Now things start to kick into gear. Barrister Ibru contacts me on the telephone.

My plan is to keep stalling him and get him really mad with me, hopefully resulting in a great phonecall later]", "[Time to start turning the \"get Ibru pissed-off\" screw]", "[There's trouble at scammer HQ. Ibru can't get his cash]", "[Dr. Pius Anyim is non too impressed either]", "[It should be noted that at this point both Dr. Pius Anyim and Barrister Ibru have called me several times on the telephone, but I have not picked up the phone. My plan is to ignore them and make them wait for a couple of days to build up their frustration. The Barrister sends me another message]", "[Finally the next day, I decide to answer the Barrister's call, but he isn't expecting my response.
