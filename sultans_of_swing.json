I have been in the bank myself to confirm the deposit of this\nmoney, before allowing Mrs Millicent to Sign my Contract Agreement in our\nChambers. She have told me that she does not want this money to be used here\nin Cote D'Ivoire as she want it to be controlled as the Lord Leads Her. She,\nas much as I have confirmed, is a true Child of God.\n \nI have been consulted by  this woman to  Represent all legal procedure for\nthe smooth movement of this  fund to you\n \nWe have made enquiries regarding the smooth transfer  of this money\nInternationally, and we have been notified by the Government of Cote\nD'Ivoire, that all necessary Approval Clearance  must be made from the\nGovernment before any transfer is made  from this money. This is because, as\na Huge some of money, Full Governments Approval  should be given to protect\nthis fund on the process of Transfer, in order to make the transfer very\neffective. Not only here in Cote D'Ivoire, but also on the arrival of this\nmoney in your country.\n \nAlso, owing to the on-going political problem in Cote D'Ivoire, as you can\nfind out in the World News, full approval should be obtained by the\ngovernment, showing that this money is not to sponsor rebels. The Government\nwill give all these Approvals. Immediately we secure these Legal Approvals,\nthis fund will smoothly be moved to your care.\n \nThe Major Document to be obtained on your behalf is a Valid AFFIDAVIT\nWARRANT linking you and the Depositor of this Fund.\n \nNow that I have received your communication on this matter, we will be in\ncontact immediately with the Ministry Of Justce Cote D'Ivoire for an\nAffidavit as demanded.

Under\nthis arrangement, this fund will be packed into a Diplomatic Luggage and\nwill be transferred to you directly on your address through a  Government\nlicenced Diplomatic Courier Company here in Cote D'Ivoire. This is refers as\nDiplomatic Delivery of Fund. It is left for you to decide on which way you\nwant to receive this fund.\n \nThis process will not take any time as much as you co-operate accordingly\nwith us. We are working on your File right now for the smooth transfer of\nthis fund. Mrs Millicent who have consulted us is seriously sick in one\nhospital here as you are aware. She have informed us to communicate with you\nalone to facilitate this matter so that this money can be transferred to\nyou. Therefore, your maximum co-operation is highly needed in this matter.\nAs soon as these Approval are procured here, this money will immediately be\ntransferred, and the bank here have told us that it will take 48/72 hours\nfor this fund to be confirmed into your bank account, after transfer from\nthe bank here.

Which method will you want us to adopt\nconcerning this transfer?\n \nBear in mind that there is no way this money can be transferred or moved to\nyou without this necessary Documents obtained and approved by the bank on\nyour name.
