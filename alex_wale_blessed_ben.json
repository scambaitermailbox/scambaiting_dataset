Your embassy will only come in after i have witrhdrawn the consignment and money from the security company and only then will i need a kind of LETTER OF INVITATION  from you to facilitate my visa application at your local embassy here.

This is the condition my father stated in his will and agreement certificate as a condition of release to me because of my minor status, i pray you understand this aspect very well because it is for this condition that i contacted you for assistance in the first place. \n\nMeanwhile i have seen the Driving Licence you sent,but did not see your physical home/business addresses that will enable the LAWYER to draft the AGREEMENT BETWEEN US AND THE AFFIDAVIT THAT WILL LEGITIMIZE THE TRANSACTION AND EMPOWER THE SECURITY COMPANY TO RELEASE THE CONSIGNMENT TO ME BEFORE I TRANSFER THE MONEY IN THE BOX INTO YOUR ACCOUNT WHICH YOU WILL SEND TO ME AS SOON AS I WITHDRAW THE CONSIGNMENT FROM THE COMPANY. \n\nTherefore it will be in our best of interest if you could send me the \u00a31.800.00 POUNDS STERLING BEFORE THE END OF THIS WEEK SO THAT I WILL GIVE IT TO THE LAWYER TO START PROCURING THE DOCUMENTS NEEDED AND TO REGISTER THEM AT THE APPROPRIATE QUARTERS WITHIN FIVE WORKING DAYS WHICH HE TOLD ME IT WILL TAKE BEFORE THEY ARE READY.      IF THEY ARE NOT REGISTERED OR NOTARIZED, the Security Company may not honour my application to withdraw and remit the money into your account for the proposed joint -venture business between you and I. \n\nI shall send you a copy of the AGREEMENT(memorandum of understanding b/w us) to sign and return to me for onward submition to the security company,as they requested,as soon as the ATTORNEY FINISHES DRAFTING IT.

Your embassy will only come in after i have witrhdrawn the consignment and money from the security company and only then will i need a kind of LETTER OF INVITATION  from you to facilitate my visa application at your local embassy here. It is the LAWYER also who needs the &pound;1.800 .00 as his CONSULTATION/SERVICE CHARGE for Procuring and Notarising the two documents at the NOTARY'S PUBLIC OFFICE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE COUNTRY OF ORIGIN OF THE FUND, i.e IVORY COAST, SO THAT YOU WILL NOT HAVE ANY PROBLEM EXPLAINING THE SOURCE OF THE FUND TO YOUR LOCAL AUTHORITIES WHEN REMITTED INTO YOUR ACCOUNT OVER THERE AFTER WITHDRAWAL,i.e;before the security company can be convinced that i have truely found a TRUSTEE with whom i will team up to run the investment in your country. This is the condition my father stated in his will and agreement certificate as a condition of release to me because of my minor status, i pray you understand this aspect very well because it is for this condition that i contacted you for assistance in the first place. <br><br>\n\nMeanwhile i have seen the Driving Licence you sent,but did not see your physical home/business addresses that will enable the LAWYER to draft the AGREEMENT BETWEEN US AND THE AFFIDAVIT THAT WILL LEGITIMIZE THE TRANSACTION AND EMPOWER THE SECURITY COMPANY TO RELEASE THE CONSIGNMENT TO ME BEFORE I TRANSFER THE MONEY IN THE BOX INTO YOUR ACCOUNT WHICH YOU WILL SEND TO ME AS SOON AS I WITHDRAW THE CONSIGNMENT FROM THE COMPANY. <br><br>\n\nTherefore it will be in our best of interest if you could send me the &pound;1.800.00 POUNDS STERLING BEFORE THE END OF THIS WEEK SO THAT I WILL GIVE IT TO THE LAWYER TO START PROCURING THE DOCUMENTS NEEDED AND TO REGISTER THEM AT THE APPROPRIATE QUARTERS WITHIN FIVE WORKING DAYS WHICH HE TOLD ME IT WILL TAKE BEFORE THEY ARE READY.      IF THEY ARE NOT REGISTERED OR NOTARIZED, the Security Company may not honour my application to withdraw and remit the money into your account for the proposed joint -venture business between you and I. <br><br>\n\nI shall send you a copy of the AGREEMENT(memorandum of understanding b/w us) to sign and return to me for onward submition to the security company,as they requested,as soon as the ATTORNEY FINISHES DRAFTING IT. You must remember that it is not a mere LETTER to be simply written by either you or I  as you put it in your last mail,but a strong worded FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT that requires the attention of a qualified LEGAL PRACTITIONER before it can be authenticated and honoured at the security company. <br><br>\n\nSo let me know how soon you can send the money because time is no longer on our side,remember:::::A STITCH IN TIME SAVES NINE.

I have no iota of doubt in my mind or reason to believe that iam being ripped off by the Lawyer i consulted to draft the documents. You seem not to appreciate the weight of those documents and understand that they are not a mere \"couple of letters\"as you put it,but financial instrument that is meant to cement our business relationship as well as legitimise the transaction by registering them at the appropriate quarters. If it were a mere letter, there wont be any need to register them in the first place,for i myself could have written it and forwarded to you to sign and send back to me without involving any Lawyer in the first instance. \n\nBesides,in my mails to you i told you already that such a financial document can not be honored both by the Security Company and the judiciary(in case either of the two parties to it falters)without being registered in the Public Notary's Office of the Supreme Court of the COUNTRY OF ORIGIN OF THE FUND.  This is the only clause that makes it unacceptable for us to have your friend in the U.K to draft the documents because he may not be able to come down here to register them at the Supreme Court, because if he is a bonafide member of the U.K BAR ASSOCIATION and is recognised over there as such,the same can not be said of him in the BAR ASSOCIATION OF THIS COUNTRY and so may not understand the intricacies of this country's legal system considering the fact that this even a FRENCH country with a pattern that is perhaps, a far-cry from what he is used to as the norms  and obtainable in the UK. \n\nWhat i think might have influenced the bill(\u00a31.800.00) the LAWYER qouted is; perhaps due to the fact that you said you can not make it to Africa at this time, added to the bulk of service your absence is going to make him render to us ,as he has to ,like i told you in my mail,HOLD FORTE FOR YOU at the SecurIty Company;in other words, he  must be seen physically by the DIRECTOR as standing for his client, i.e you as my TRUSTEE because of the condition of release given to the security company by my late father. The presence of the Trustee would convince the director that ,with my TRUSTEE, my chances of putting this money to frivolous use will be so drastically reduced that any cheque i want to draw from the account when released to you must be approved by  YOU the said TRUSTEE before it can be honoured .  \n\nAnother area i think must have influenced that \"high\" bill is the implication of being pysically present at the SECURITY COMPANY next week, when we have scheduled the withdrawal of the consignment ,and  that the small DEMURRAGE which the consignment has incured so far will as well be settled by the ATTORNEY on your behalf and from that same BILL(\u00a31.800.00).So if you deduct the cost of REGISTERING or NOTARISING the documents and what he has to pay as DEMURRAGE to the company to effect the release,as well as conducting the OATH- SWEARING EXCERCISE AT THE SUPREME COURT on my behalf stating that you are my appointed TRUSTEE(not counting his ETHICALLY MANDATORY CONSULTATION FEES) you will then  agree with me that he might have charged much less than the \u00a380.00 you said it could cost overthere to simply  DRAFT THE DOCUMENTS.Listen carefully my good friend, I am a very careful and articulate young man when it comes to anything money and so did extensive arithmetics on my own before i accepted to pay so much for all that services. I DO NOT THINK HE IS REAPING US OFF IN ANY MANNER. \n\nIt is only as a result of your inability to come down that created room for the Attorney if not it wil not have cost us nothing  more than the small demurrage incured before we withdraw the consignment. for your presence  alone is what the securty company director needs to see to be empowered to release the consignment to me, as was stated in the condition of release , because of fear i might not be able to control(as a minor i am) the huge amount he concealed in the consignment at the time of deposit.   REMEMBER THAT THE SECURTY COMPANY SO FAR, HAS NO IDEA WHATSOEVER THAT THE CONSIGNMENT CONTAINS PHYSICAL CASH AMONG THE \"VALUABLES\" as was declared by my late father. ONLY YOU AND I KNOW ALL THAT.  SO YOU MUST PROMISE ME OF UTMOST SECRECY IN THIS ASPECT, UNTILL WE WITHDRAW IT NEXT WEEK AND I START REMITTING IT INSTALMENTALLY INTO YOUR ACCOUNT. \n\nConcerning the VAT BILL you mentioned in your last mail,if it will not be too late to pay it next month,then what i think what we should do now is simply use that sum already in your account to offset the LAWYER'S BILL FIRST SO THAT BY NEXT WEEK WHEN WE WITHDRAW THE CONSIGNMENT, the first money i will send to you will be enough to even buy a home for me in advance and have enough to put back into your account for your VAT BILL.  You may find this a little difficult to believe because you are not here with me and you do not see what i see  ,but if only you can make it down here next week,both of us will visit the security company : only then can you see things clearly with your own eyes and not from my spectacle ,as is the case right now. At one point before i contacted you ,i was almost tempted to reach a compromise with the lawyer to assist me procure all the documents and pay the demurrage after withdrawal i pay him with 100%interest on the original bill which i am sure he would have  jumped at,but after deep consideration of the impact of going contrary to my late father's advice while on his sick bed, that for no reason whatsoever should i reveal to any one that the consignment contains cash except my trustee, because of fear that my life and securty might be seriously compromised or jeopardised. So i reasoned that if iam forced by circumstances to enter such an agreement with him or any one around here, the person may insist on seeing the contents of the consignment when released. \n\nSo my friend, if you really want to help me and help yourself this is the only time or way \n\nyou can do that because you know iam not a citizen of this country and as such had paid my hotel bill up till next weekend when i had scheduled to round up this withdrawal process and have access to my inheritance. I can not afford to stay in this hotel if by next weekend iam yet to withdraw that consignment from the security company.Please do anything possible to see that you send the money today so i can forward it to the LAWYER to enable him procure all the requisite documents and REGISTER them ,before presenting them to the DIRECTOR.

I never meant to make fun of you ,far from it. <br><br>\n\nOf course, we can not use a UK lawyer for the obvious reasons i had communicated to you already and i believe that you quite understood the key points made to that effect. I however feel deeply touched by the temporary inconvenience that could  cause you concerning the VAT you must pay to keep your business running till i gain access to my inheritance and only then  be in a position to wire ,first and foremost ,that basic sum you are going to send for those two documents and so on.  <br><br>\n\n I understand  how uncertain it could appear to your  as regards how soon  i am going to be through with the Security company to be able to send you this sum immediately its withdrawn. All i have to tell you as regards that is (1) IF I AM NOT COCK-SURE OF RAISING THAT MONEY FROM THE CONSIGNMENT AND SEND SOME OF IT TO YOU FIRST I CAN NOT GO AHEAD TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO PUT  IN WHAT LITTLE MONEY YOU HAD MANAGED TO SAVE UP TO BE ABLE TO PAY YOUR VAT.(2)IF I SHOULD GO AHEAD AND ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO THAT WHEN I AM MAKING PLANS TO EXPAND AND CONTINUE WITH THAT YOUR SAME LINE OF BUSINESS,WHAT DO I STAND TO GAIN IF AT THE END YOU HAVE LOST THE SHOP (DUE TO YOUR INABILITY TO PAY YOUR VAT) FROM WHERE I HOPE WE COULD START FROM ,THE MOMENT I COME OVER; WHAT BENEFIT THEN WOULD I HAVE IN ALL THAT.(3) I HAD A HARD TIME STRUGLING WITH MY CONSCIENCE FOR MAKIING YOU PART WITH THAT SUM ,EVEN WHEN I AM CONVINCED THAT AS SOON AS WE GET THE DOCUMENTS,THEY WILL RELEASE MY MONEY TO ME, WHAT ON EARTH WILL  THEN MAKE ME NOT TO SEND YOU IMMEDIATELY WHAT MONEY I KNOW IS NECESSARY TO KEEP YOUR SHOP GOING UNTILL I ARRIVE WITH THE WHOLE FUND AND SOME OF THE OTHER VALUABLES IN THE CONSIGNMENT WHICH FOR NOW,I KNOW YOU DO NOT KNOW HAS GEM STONES IN IT.THIS  ALONE,IF SENT TO YOU FIRST OF ALL,BY DHL BULK COURIER SERVICE WOULD GIVE YOU MORE THAN YOU NEED TO PAY THE VAT. I BLAME ONLY MY FATHER FOR ATTACHING ALL THAT RELEASE COPNDITION TO THE ONLY SUSTAINABLE LEGACY I CAN SAY HE LEFT BEHIND FOR ME (4) IN AS MUCH AS I UNDERSTAND HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT SENDING MONEY TO SOME ONE YOU NEVER KNEW FROM ADAMS,I AM NOT HAPPY THAT YOU STILL CONSIDER ME A STRANGER AFTER ALL I HAVE REVEALED  ABOUT  MY FAMILY SECRETS TO YOU WHOM  I TOO COULD HAVE WITHHELD SUCH INFORMATION FROM . <br><br>\n\n I THOUGHT WE ARE TOGETHER AS PARTNERS WHO ARE YET TO MEET,BUT HAVE MAXIMUM TRUST IN EACH OTHER. I WAS SO TOUCHED BY THAT ASPECT OF YOUR MAIL,THAT IF I HAD A CHOICE WOULD HAVE TAKEN IT INSTEAD OF DEPENDING ON ANY ONE AT ALL TO HELP ME PAY SO LITTLE AND MORTGAGE MY CONTROL OVER  MY INHERITANCE FOR AS LONG IT TAKES TO ROUND UP MY DEGREE PROGRAMMES IN THE UK.

Most of what I know of that continent comes from watching wildlife documentaries on the television.  A lot of them are done by a man called Attenborough (or 'Dickie' to his friends).  Have you ever met him?  it wouldn't surprise me if you had, he spends a lot of time there.  I watch the television at night with my cat, \"Sook\".

There is so much you don't seem to know  about Africa and Africans, it will be my greatest pleasure to join you in less than no time and share with you physically my experiences  here. Could bring wildlife films and documentaries when coming. I am touched also by the descriptive skill  you exhibit by painting a clear  picture of  what your home lifestyle looks like. With each mail you send to me, it is as if a powerful whirl wind pulls me towards your most transparent nature i can feel from your mails. \n\nAlex, in all frankness you are one person in hundreds whom i notice never wastes a second to express his  real frame of mind on in all situations.This trait of yours has a way of conveying the impression of an honest and most reliable fellow.

So far it is the safest way to send money to people like me who do not have any bank accounts in another country. The only account i can lay claims to as mine is my late father's account which i can not yet operate without a Trustee because of my status as a minor and most of all considering the huge amout it contains. This is the only reason i contacted you in the first place.     \n\nSending money through western union or Moneygram is as safe as sending it through a Bank because before the money is released to the receiver,the western union or Moneygram staff must ensure that the receiver is officially identified through his or her Internationl passport and that he answers corrtecty, the secret question which the sender will be asked to include as an additional code to the control numbers which the western union will give to the sender as soon as the sender hands over the sum  to them. You the sender, will now send the control code number and the question and answer to  the receiver in another country,(Ivory Coast) before they release the money to  the receiver . \n\nSo in this case all you have to do is simply walk into any western union office Nearest to you and inform the fellow you must meet accross the counter  by writing, that you want to send the sum of \u00a31.800 to a friend in ABIDJAN, IVORY COAST. \n\nThey will now give you a form to fill in your name and the name of the friend you wish to send the money to. In the form,you will find a column where you will be required to chose any question and answer that tickles your fancy as an additional code to the control number which they will  now write  boldly behind your own copy of the same form you filled. For example:Question;= what is the name of my cat. Answer:= Sook. Once you have finished filling the form,you will then be asked to deposit the money at the counter and they will give you a copy of the same form you filled after puting down their stamp , signature and the control code written at the back of the ordinary form you filled. This is enough guarantee to you that if the receiver did not receive the money, you would be refunded with apologies as long as you provide an evidence, i.e your own copy of the form you filled. So do not tear the form untill i have written and confirmed to you that i have received the money.\n\nNow as soon as you step out of their office,the next thing to do is to send me a mail stating the Control Numbers,Question and answer, name of sender, name of receiver, destination, e.g Abidjan,  Ivory Coast , origin e.g, Nothingham,or Glasgow ,as the case may be,United Kongdom and that's all.\n\nSo try and send it tomorrow and mail me the particulars as above,so that first thing on Monday morning will be to hand the information over to the lawyer,that is if you are sending it directly to the Lawyer ANTOINE G.KONAN or in my name Blessed   Christi  Bernard.

This Ben that knows so much about somebody in Africa and is proved right at the end of the day might as well know somethings about my late father or his colleagues whom i do not even want to see untill we are through .You know that only you and i know that my father was a shipping magnate who had to sell of his share in the shipping company to make it easier for me to use the proceeds to pursue my own interests instead of rubbing shoulders in his absence ,with his colleagues  whom he feared might plot  to eliminate me to have a field day in the company with their own kids as co directors: you know also that i can not afford any mistakes at this stage of my waiting to assume control over my inheritance. \n\nConcerning how to resend the money, there is no other choice better or easier,more convenient than western union,because i have been able to find another lawyer who will procure the documents within three days as long as i am able to pay him outright for his services ,unlike the two weeks the lawyer antoine konan told me,probably because he  (antoine konan)had planned to use the two long weeks to perfect his plans to withdraw the consignment on his own with the enabling Power of Attorney i must issue to him and while i would still be waiting for a mere documents to be available, he would have succeeeded in withdrawing it from the company without my knowledge and for his selfish interest. This new lawyer told me that he is not even a lawyer in the first place,but took advantage of the net to advertise his name there to reap off unsuspecting and innocent members of the public under the guise and capacity of a lawyer. He also reminded me that a good lawyer need n't even advertise in the first place to woo a client,but that his reputation as a proffessional will be all that is needed to fetch him the trust of clients and not by publicity which he told me is quite unethical for any proffessional to advertise .As i write this mail ,i still feel pangs of goose pimples all over me at the thought of what my fate would have been like if you weren\"t there  \n\nSo please send it by western union so i can take it to this new lawyer whom i am sure of his identity and can vouch for, because a senior member of our congregation personally introduced this one to me, but i never disclosed the reason why i needed a lawyer to brother Lazarus who introduced him.

Have you thought about what you're going to do with your late father's money when it is released to your care? You can't put that sort of cash under the mattress, or carry it around with you, and you're going to need somewhere to put those gems. If the 'Visa' bank that you visited yesterday required you to be a customer in order to manage the transfer, then why didn't you open an account with them, there and then? You could have killed two birds with one stone.  \n\nThe man at my bank, Dennis Norden is his name, (he's hard to lip read because he's always sucking a bloody mint!), told me that the limit for western union transfers from Murray's to the Ivory Coast is \u00a3500.   This limit is 'daily', meaning that I would have to go in four times to move the \u00a31800 pounds you need, and each one has a fee of \u00a316.  It's a rip off if you ask me; I think that they are trying to make money out of legitimate transfers to foreign parts.

It makes amazing reading, did you know that are more U.S. dollars reputed to be locked up in safe deposit boxes in Nigeria than the U.S. Government has actually printed? And if they actually existed and were all \"released\" back into circulation, it would bring about the fall of the western economy! \n\nI'm pleased to see that you've already arranged for a new lawyer, because I think that this is almost as imperative as you opening a bank account, as obviously the two go hand in hand towards the completion of this project.   Paying into a bank account would be almost instantaneous, whereas the \"western union\" route is going to take at least four working days (that doesn't include Saturday or Sunday for banks in the UK).  So, it will now take us into Easter.

Perhaps it would be a good idea for him to send things to me directly rather than to keep having you go to the office; it's not good that you have to keep missing school like this.  \n\nI was pleased with the news that your legacy is even bigger than you first suggested!

I understand how you feel about me not having a bank account; it has been part of my game plan to open one as soon as i have the consignment released to me,only then can i have a financial instrument with which to remit the money in different instalments into your local account at Murray's Mint Bank. It is true we have not discussed this i have always had it at the back of my mind,of course i can never imagine myself hoping to leave safely with such money here in Africa because that is why i sollicited for your assistance from the begining.  \n\nThe process of opening an account here is not as authomatic as it is overthere.\n\nIt requires a guarantor among the bank customers before you can open an account.Besides the category of accout i can afford to open right now, may not be enough to carry such transaction. Of course while there, at the only bank i saw that had the visa card on, i made futile efforts to see if i could open one in a day or two and was told the difference between current account and savings account and that each one had their modus -operandi and there is a limit to the amount you can use to open it. For the transaction i have in mind, i know that when iam ready to open  an account it will definetely have to be a Current account, because savings account i am made to understand ,can not carry such transaction. \n\nI am happy to hear that you were able to recall the money and sorry about the loss on interest charges,but the opnly assurance i am giving you now is that it will not be too late to resend you the VAT money since you said the need for it is towards the end of April. There is no problem about sending it four times because even the new lawyer must not have the total money at once because there a different stages of need . For example if by monday you have  been able to send the first five hundred pounds, that means that he could start procuring the documents and within two or three days,as he said,it will take him to register it at the Public Notary's Office,i would have received the remaining .Remember that part of that bill is to settle the demurrages incured on the deposit. So i have discussed this with him and he has no problem reciving the money in bits ,since he is not going to need all of them on the same day. It is a stage- by -stage \ntranaction. And within this time frame the documents are put in place and they will release my money, i am certain i will be able to round up this whole thing before the end of the month.\n\nSo Uncle, let it be the only favour you can do for me in life ,for i can not have the kind of trust i have in you with anybody else in the world. I have long lost interest in even my late father's relatives because of the way they scrambled my father's property from my helpless mother before she died. I do not even trust any one around here who knows my family background it is as if any one that smiled at me did that because he envied my inheritance or wanted something from me.You understand that kind of feeling?\n\nAll you have to do is go to your bank tomrrow ,Saturday morning and withdraw the \u00a31.800 at once and go straight to the nearest western union and send the first five hundred to me so that by monday morning the lawyer would start his work in earnest. By moday  morning you send the second and the third on tuesday by wednesday which is about the third day the lawyer mentioned earlier on ,it will take him to be through,we would have rounded up every thing simultaneously as we are withdrawing the last batch that would be used to settle the small demurrage and perhaps other miscaleneous expenses like hiring a bullion van from the securty to a bank for the account opening and onward installmental remittance into your account. \n\n I have discussed with him (the new lawyer) the likelyhood of the money coming in four different instalments and he sees nothing wrong with that. He was able to see it from my spectacles that he wouldn't be needing all of that at once but according to the different stages of the transaction.He said the first Affidavit to be sworn will be the one that makes you not only my Trustee,but also my foster father .he believes that the adoption idea is all i need if i do not want to raise too many eyebrows at the bank,as the documents in question will then enable the bank to look up to you and relate with you as such,otherwise if there are no such a solid foundation of relation between us ,the bank may be tempted to see you as attempting to defraud my account. Only then will this transaction be seen from the \"scam\"point of view  you mentioned in your mail because of lack of proper documentation. \n\nSo start sending the money in instalments from saturday so that by wednesday we are through from all angles and have enough time to withdraw and send to you for the VAT .Remember that our initial calculations of how soon we can be through was done based on the two,weeks time schedule proposed by that old lawyer and the new lawyer has said that all the documents need'nt beyond three working days to be through. \n\n I pray that the Almighty God should continue to guide you in all you lay your hands on till all this is over. i feel a pang of conscience to worry about this expenses, but i do promise you that, as soon as every thing is Ok, we shall both have cause to smile and to glorify the name of God for his undeserved mercies to those who excercise faith in all they do. \n\nHoping to hear from you tomorrow, thanks once again for being there for us.\n\nRemain blessed and even more prayerful in the Lord.\n\n \nFrom Blessed Ben", "raw": "<hr> \n\n\n \n\n<span class=\"bb\">Blessed Ben</span><br><br><span class=\"st\">\n\n\n\nDear Uncle Alex,  (April 8th 1.10 pm)\n<br><br>\nI am very sorry  about the small delay in giving you reply to your mail concerning the opening of an account or four installmental remittance of the money.The reason  is that i had written from the second paragraph of this same mail and sent it ,but it did not go.only this morning when i came to check for your rtesponse to iot that i realised the mail did not go that yesterday evening. so try and send the response to this mail later today, for tomorrow is not a working day here in ivory coast.so i can receive the first five hundred for the initial documents first thing on monday morning.<br><br>\n\n Your mail i received this evening made sense to me from all angles.

I'll go round there first thing tomorrow when they open.  \n<br><br>\nI'm sorry you had a wasted journey and I'll get to the bottom of it don't you worry, or my name isn't Alex Wale.<br><br>\n\nYours<br><br>\n\nAlex\n </span>\n\n<br><br>\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "", "author_role": "bait", "body": "Dear Ben,  (11th April 9.10 am)\n\nGood News.\n\nYou'll be pleased to know that I've managed to get to the western union office this morning and sorted things out.\n\nI was invited into the manager's office, a Mr. Attely, and had a long conversation (well, it's always long when you have to write it down) and explained what I wanted to do and what had gone wrong.
