I and my partners were instrumental in the hotel winning a considerable award for damages in that case and it received considerable news coverage in this part of Europe). I maintain a small office in the Hotel Bolshoi Shutka in Kiev, Georgia, but my time spent there varies considerably and is at best uncertain.

My partners have pretty much complete access to all of my communications except for my personal email account. In other words, I'm afraid that our correspondence will have to be restricted to email, at least for the short term, to preserve the security of my position with my firm. My ex-wife broke me of the habit of carrying a mobile phone - she used it like a homing torpedo to always know my whereabouts.

Mr. Yahaya, I think if you check with your supervisor you will find that it is standard business practice worldwide to send the invoice BEFORE payment is made. The invoice is a statement of what is owed, not what is payed. After I make the fee payment I will be expecting you to send me a receipt stating that payment has been made.<br><br>\n\nI suspect that you are a young man who is new to the business world and I don't want you to be discouraged by this error as no harm has been done. Please scan the formal invoice and send it to me at your earliest convenience.<br><br>\n\nRegards.<br><br>\n\nLewis D.

Today!<br><br>\n\nI appreciate you sending the invoice, and it certainly looks real and genuine! But listen guys, I'm gonna tell you what I tell all my mugus - you're really, really not cut out for this. You gotta quit hanging out in those internet cafes trying to pass yourselves off as heavy hitters; it just doesn't fly. You're wasting your time at this, go find a job somewhere.<br><br>\n\nAnd you, Yahaha, are undoubtedly among the worst at it. Your personality is like fingernails on a chalkboard, you're an irritating little prick, and I still have half a mind to come down there and get tribal on your ass. Just thank your lucky stars I'm busy next week.<br><br>\n\nAnd you might as well know that Hilman doesn't like you either. In one of his emails he was telling me how your mama is so ugly that she once had wild, passionate sex with a donkey, after which the donkey, overcome with shame, committed suicide by throwing himself off a cliff. At the time I thought it was kind of a cold thing to say but now I think he's probably right.<br><br>\n\nHilman, if you get your 35 million come on up to Latvia sometime and we'll have a few beers and some more laughs over this. But leave your dimwitted partner at home.<br><br>\n\nOk, fellas, it's been fun. Take care and don't forget to write.<br><br>\n\nYour pal,<br>\nLewd<br><br>\n\nps - Hilman, Oxnard sends her love and says for you to get stuffed.<br><br>\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "2004-11-26 08:01", "subject": "", "author_role": "scam", "body": "LEWD,\n\nWHAT IS THIS?????????????
