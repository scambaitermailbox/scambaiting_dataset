I have noted all your instructions.

This would not be a problem I assure you.\n\n\nI have drafted the Memorandum of Agreement for you detailing the next course of action.  Please note your response to this email is very important.\n\n\nTo confirm my trust and my full commitment to working with you in this transaction, I have also included a copy of my driver's licence for your attention.
