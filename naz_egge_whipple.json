The victim pays with a money order. The goods never arrive. In the reverse version - the <i>victim</i> is trying to sell something, rent a room, whatever -  the Lads send a bogus cashier's check for too much money and ask the victim to return the 'excess' amount in the form of a money order. The bogosity of the cashier's check will usually not be discovered in time. Sometimes the Lads have an in-country partner-in-crime who receives the bogus checks in bulk and re-mails them to the victims.
