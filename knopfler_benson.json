I have given him all the information he asks for but then he asks me for it again. He doesnt sound very competant. Can we find someone else?\nI am flying out to Siera Leone on 24th Feb on flight BA6655 an d expect to arrive late in the evening. I havnt heard back from you yet regarding somewhere to stay. The last ime I was in a hotel in california there were eagles everywhere. I am not from a celibate order and so hopefully will find some lady loving while I am there. I dont want to be in heartbreak hotel during my visit. Brother Leonard Cohen likes the Chelsea hotel so I would like something similar to that. Its in Sloane Square in London so if you have a look there on the web Im sure you will get the idea of what we are looking for. I hope that looking for ladies doesnt have and problem with the police. They often smell and I have to tell them not to stand so close to me and I dont want anyone to be putting on a red light, particularly sister Roxanne otherwise Ill be so lonely. There will be about 5 of us coming now. Will we need sunblock, I have heard its an invisible sun but still very powerful. Do you have a beach nearby, I was hoping to send a message in a bottle to my friends, always been a wish.\n\nAnyway, I am excited to be coming over as you can probably tell and look forward to seeing you very soon.\n\nBr Mark", "raw": "<hr>\n\n<span class=\"mk\">Brother Mark Knopfler</span><br /><br /><span class=\"ast\">\n \n Date: Tue, 20 Feb 2007<br /> <br />\nTo: BENSON JACK &lt;bensonjackbj@yahoo.com&gt;<br /><br />\n\n\nDear Benson<br /><br />\n\nI am slightly worried about this barrister fellow.
