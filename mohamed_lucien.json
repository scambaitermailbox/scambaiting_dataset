That is what Mr. Paddy Max agreed\nto do for me. I did NOT expect the diplomat to deliver the trunk\nbox. I will take care of receiving the box later through some other\nform of shipment to the USA. I simply want the diplomat to be paid\nbefore someone else lays claim to the box.\nMr. Max Paddy has the cash ($11,000 which can be converted to British\nSterling if you like), but it will be necessary for someone to meet\nhim in Glasgow, Scotland. That is a simple task that diplomats do\nall the time. It would be the same thing if Mr. Max Paddy came to\nLondon to meet Mr. Michael Dannis or an associate. Please get this\ndone as quickly as possible so we can quit wasting time.\nSincerely,\nEd Shanks\n\n\n\n", "from_name": "Ed Shanks", "subject": "", "to_name": "Mohamed Lucien", "comments": []}, {"author_role": "scam", "date": "22nd Feb 2005", "raw": "            <p><b>From:</b> Mohamed Lucien<br>\n              <b>To:</b> Ed Shanks<br>\n              <b>Date:</b> 22nd Feb 2005<br>\n              <b>Subject</b>: i will try to get the diplomat to glasgow</p>\n            <p><i>Sahara clinic &amp; Matternity,<br>\n              P.o.Box 333.
