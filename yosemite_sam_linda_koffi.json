It looks like he don't know the first thing about bankin and dealin!!! First off, I didn't ask you fer no deposit, I asked him, that varmit! Thats the way we do business around here. I don't know that sorry rascal from nobody, so I reckon he's likely to run off with not jest my money, but yers too! If'n he puts up a deposit first, he ain't as likely ta run off. You need to see if'n they got anybody at that two-bit bank that knows anything bout business  deals that can git this deal cookin!<br>\nsecond of all, I never said that I don't trust you or little Frankie, but now that ye mention it, heck no, I don't trust ANYBODY when it comes to my money....thats how I got all of it! It takes a dang fool ta jest go sendin money to ANYBODY!!! Now, ya see, if'n he sends a small deposit, I'll send him a sack of money, he can git the deal done, you can git the money outta his sorry bank, pay him his deposit back and all his fees, like he's really worth anything, and then you all will have the money to come over here. That oughtta be simple! Heck, I don't even care bout my cut, like I said, I got a bunch of money anyway. But I WILL trust you to make it over here with whatever cut ya wanna give me.\nNow, whats this about 'ol Hillary a-fussin you out? Why, that sorry, no-count, good fer nothin, no bank dealin, varmit!! He ain't got no business jumpin on you bout this! Why, I oughtta git over there and make mincemeat outta that  worthless pot-likker! I'm a-gonna email his sorry butt and give him a piece of my mind!<br>\nMs. Linda, see if'n you can find somebody at that no-count bank that knows anything. And let me know what ye find out!
