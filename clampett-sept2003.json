We've had a\nlittle bit of a crisis here at the homestead. Seems Elly Mae\n(she's my daughter) got to fancyin' she'd raise some\nchinchillas a while back. Elly Mae loves critters of all\nkinds. So she got herself some chinchillas. Boy them little\ncritters sure breed a mite quick! 'Fore too long the whole\nmansion was overrun with chinchillas. We're chasing'em all\nover the place. Let me tell you it's not a pleasant surprise\nwhen you sit down to go to the toilet and one of'em pops up\nfrom the porcelain receptacle and bites you in the... well,\nyou can imagine.<br>\nThis is a chinchilla.<br><br>\n\n<img src=\"images/clampett_chinchilla.jpg\"><br><br>\n\nThen Elly Mae found out what it is they wants the\nchinchillas for...<br><br>\n\nNow she won't part with them. Them mangy buggers are running\nlike crazy all over the place. There's one of the little\nfellers nibbling at my toes right this minute. I don't know\nwhat we're going to do, and Elly Mae says there's no way\nshe's gonna let anybody skin them for fur coats. I wonder\nwhat chinchilla stew would taste like?...<br><br>\n\n>I have tried calling Craig yesterday but the phone was on\nvoicemail and i left a message.<br><br>\n\n>Please, tell me if it is better to send him a fax since you\nalso<br>\n>gave me his fax number or can he call me, my phone is on\n24hours.<br>\n>He can call 234 1 7763615, or 234 8033304784.<br><br>\n\nWell, if your phone is on 24 hours, I'm sure you'll have no\nproblem calling him at 7:00 PM Nigeria time, which is 10:00\nAM Beverly Hills time. Mr. Kolasinski works 9-5, which is\n6PM-2AM Nigeria time. Keep calling, Mr. Kolasinski will give\nyou the bank account over the phone, only after verbal\nconfirmation of the password, spoken clearly and firmly, \"I\nwant the enema\".\n<br><br>\nIt is better to call than to send a fax. The fax is not\nconfidential, and can be seen by prying eyes. Remember, as\nwe say here, the walls have ears, the windows have eyes, the\ngrindstones have noses, the shredders have fingers, the\ndesks have tongues. Know what I mean?<br><br>\n\n>As for the information you sent, I am aware that Jim Ovia\nis<br>\n>the Executive Director of Zenith International Bank, if he\nhas<br>\n>asked for those things then send me the full information so<br>\n>that i will know >what to do.<br><br>\n\nConsidering that the only way Mr. Ovia could have learnt of\nme was from you, why don't you just go back to where you\nknow you can find him, and let the two of you sort this out.\nHow about that, OK?<br><br>\n\nGood luck, and make haste!

I work\nin the same bank  where this fund is to be transferred you\nknow and i will not allow anybody to cheat us when i am\nright here.I must always see to it that your interest is\nprotected at all cost. This is why we are partners you know.\n\nThe fact about this matter was not only tax, there is the\nissue of death certificate as well and also the affidavit.\nFrom what the Lawywer said we need to spend about $40,550 to\nget the three documents submitted to the bank. The 100%\nassurance i am given you is that once we have been able to\nget these papers submitted the fund will arrive your account\nin America within three days.\n\nThe Government of your Country is the best in world today\nand you want to equate the kind of good governance that you\npeople enjoy over there with what is seen in third world\ncountries like ours. This is a third world country where all\nprocesses are still very far from what is obtained in your\ncountry.We are still 1000 years behind you over there.\n\nFor instance, in this country, if i commit an offence, the\npolice can arrest my father or my son if they can not lay\nthere hands on me, can something like that happen in your\ncountry?\n\nMoreover, you know that this is a deal known to only me and\nyou, if we begin to argue too much the Lawyer and even the\nbank will have reasons to doubt that you may not  the real\nnext of kin.  And again, you need not tell any Mr Drysdale\nanything about this transaction. It is confidential please.\nJust simply arrange and have this fund paid to the Lawyer\nand we will have this fund released to us immediately.\n\nI have the sum of $10,000 which i can add to what you have\nso that we pay as soon as possible. Please, tell the Lawyer\nthat friend of yours will send him $10k and that you will\nsend the rest from America, ask him to advise you how the\nremaining $30,550  will be transferred to him.\n\nPlease, Uncle Jed, try to understand that in this kind of\ntransaction, we have to obey the rules and not argue so that\nthe transfer will be very smooth.I will hope to hear from\nyou soon.\n\nThis  issue will be concluded in the next few days if we are\nable to act according  instructions.\n\nRegards,\n\nMike.\n\n</pre>\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "2003-02-20 05:51", "subject": "Re: Witholding taxes", "author_role": "bait", "body": "X-Originating-Ip: 216.139.169.148\nX-Originating-Server: ws1-4.us4.outblaze.com\n\nMR CLAMPETT,\n\nSIR,\n\nYOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND ONE THING AND THAT IS THE FACT THAT\nTHE GOVERNMENT DID NOT ASK YOU TO PAY THE TAX NOW, THE LAW\nIS THAT IF YOU WANT THE TAX CLEARANCE ISSUED, THEN PAY THE\nTAX.

I am\nPRINCE PETER KABILA ,the son of the former head of state/\npresident of Congo-Kinshasha (then called Zaire) Mr. Laurent\nDesire Kabila.\nI am contacting you in order to ask for your assistance on\nthis confidential Business proposal with full financial\nbenefit for both of us.\nBefore I go into further details please be informed that I\nam writing without any other person(s) pre-knowledge of my\ncontacting you on this transaction. Therefore I will\nappreciate same attitude to be maintained all through.\nI have the sum of USD55Million from a secret sale of Diamond\nby my father before he was assassinated by one of his body\nguard (Rashid) on January 16th 2001, which I will like you\nto receive on my behalf due to security reasons,as my\nnarration below will explain. But before I continue be well\ninformed that your share in this transaction has been\ncalculated at 15% of the total sum of USD$55M, 5% for\nexpenses and the rest for my family and me.\nMy father as a real African traditionalist was a polygamist\nthereby having married so many wives, and my mother being\nthe second wife of my father, My step brother Joseph, who is\nthe current president of my country, is the son of the first\nwife and he does not have any knowledge about this deal.\nAlready president Joseph is using his power to colonize all\nthe money and private property, which my father left behind\nfor the whole family. Now my mother and I are left with\nnothing in the inheritance of my late father's wealth. Our\nsituation is seriously critical that we need your assistance\nto help us receive these funds overseas for proper\ninvestment.\nLet me quickly assure you the 100% safe proof of this\ntransaction because the diamond sales are packaged from the\nonset in a pattern that shows no direct trace or linkage\nwith us (Kabila family). At present the money is in cash and\nis secured in a financial institution company as\nconsignment.\nThe consignment will be released within seven (7) days of my\nbeing in receipt of your reply via my email address above\nonly for security reasons.\nI am waiting for your swift and favorable response, and in\ncase you have any question(s), do not hesitate to contact\nme.\nmy alternative e mail address is:(princekabila2003@usa.com)\nmy private phone number is :+229-988-039.\n\nBEST REGARDS,\n\nPETER  KABILA\n\n</pre>\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "", "author_role": "bait", "body": "Y'all come back now - hear?", "raw": "<hr>\n<b>Y'all come back now - hear?</b><br>\n\n</td>\n<td width=15%></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<br>\n\n\n<p><font size=-1><a href=\"http://www.scamorama.com\"><font color=\"purple\"><i>scamorama</i></font></a></font><br>\n", "comments": []}]}
