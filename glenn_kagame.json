Payne Diaz\n\n  \n\n\n\nDearest Brother Michael, \n\n     Thank you for your latest e-mail and your expressions of support for our\nefforts to locate our mutual friend, Glenn, and that miserable sow, Melissa,\nhis accountant-moll, who have gone missing for some time now.  I would have\nanswered you much sooner but I could not for legal reasons.  It would take too\nlong to explain to you the full meaning of the legal phrase, \"Two weeks\ninvoluntary commitment\" but suffice to note that for fourteen days I was kept\naway from computers, televisions, radios, refrigerators, toasters, and even the\noccasional three-prong wall outlet.  Well, if \"observation\" is what they had in\nmind, I whose meanings they'll be arguing about in staff meetings for a long\ntime to come!  Anyway, I'm back out now; they dropped me off in an alley near\nmy home during the night and one of the first things I did was check my e-mail.\n  \n     Thanks, too, for your expression of love and support for Glenn; yes,\nindeed, as your wrote, Glenn is so full of affection and love for all of us. \nMany in the extended university community would also add some other ingredients\nGlenn has in fuller than normal measure but, again, it would take too long to\nexplain them all in the vernacular.\n     Anyway, we've resumed our search for Glenn and Wattzername - in fact, I\nbelieve that is her last name, Wattzername - but we've had to keep a low\nprofile.  Our secret informants advise that that Dutch police deaf squad is\nstill cruising around town, signing obscenities at pedestrians and collecting\norders for wooden shoes.  Dirty, brutish beasts that they are, the stench of\ntheir urine in Glenn's office has barely subsided; is asparagus the only thing\nthat they eat in Dutchland?\n    In keeping our low profile, we've been spending most days in a squat along\nthe south bank of the Sasquatchaqualmie River, downing brew and pretzels in\nsuper-size quantities, trolling for crappies, and rolling over the floaters\nthat drift by on the current.  Did you know that when they pop up three days or\nso afterwards, women float on their backs and men float face-down? Honest,\nninety-five times out of a hundred! Melissa Wattzername, however, could be\nexpected to float by butt up.\n    The last we heard still was that Glenn and That Woman were on their way to\nLegos and were planning to build a full-size oil refinery out of those little\nplastic bricks and things; does this make any sense to you or is tat the LSD\ntalking again?. You keep writing that they were supposed to be in Nigeria. \nSomeone told me that Nigeria is just off Interstate 40 between Knoxville and\nNashville but darned if I can find it on a map! Is Nigeria closer to you or to\nme? Didn't a lander find water on NIgeria? Or was that ALgeria? Your e-mail\nsaid something garbles about them being expected at the Elko Meridian Hotel but\nwe contacted every hotel, motel, transient camp, church mission and sheriff's\nchain gang in northern Nevada without success. Did you perhaps mean WINNEMUCCA?\nNow, that's a nice town, Winnemucca, Nevada; they actually publish a guide to\nthe local brothels and coupons for twofers on weeknights.\n     So it goes! We'll continue our search and hope you will keep us informed\nif you hear something before we do. \n\n                                               Sincerely,\n \n\n                                               A.Payne DIAZ, M.A. in Art\nHistory", "raw": "    <hr><b><font color=\"brown\">A. PAYNE DIAZ</font></b><br><br>\n\n\nDear Mr. Konpart,\n\n  <br><br>\n\nMr Michael Kagame has requested that I contact you to receive my 25 million\nU.S. dollars.  He is attempting to spirit away gold and diamonds and I am\nassisting him in this venture.  Where do I collect.  I will fly anywhere any\ntime.  Can you send me a check?\n\n  <br><br>\n\n   A.   Payne Diaz\n\n  <br><br>\n\n<i> My friend A. Payne Diaz writes another part to the saga and I cover with\nmultiple personality disorder.</i><br><br>\n\n\nDearest Brother Michael, <br><br>\n\n     Thank you for your latest e-mail and your expressions of support for our\nefforts to locate our mutual friend, Glenn, and that miserable sow, Melissa,\nhis accountant-moll, who have gone missing for some time now.  I would have\nanswered you much sooner but I could not for legal reasons.  It would take too\nlong to explain to you the full meaning of the legal phrase, \"Two weeks\ninvoluntary commitment\" but suffice to note that for fourteen days I was kept\naway from computers, televisions, radios, refrigerators, toasters, and even the\noccasional three-prong wall outlet.  Well, if \"observation\" is what they had in\nmind, I whose meanings they'll be arguing about in staff meetings for a long\ntime to come!  Anyway, I'm back out now; they dropped me off in an alley near\nmy home during the night and one of the first things I did was check my e-mail.\n  <br><br>\n     Thanks, too, for your expression of love and support for Glenn; yes,\nindeed, as your wrote, Glenn is so full of affection and love for all of us. \nMany in the extended university community would also add some other ingredients\nGlenn has in fuller than normal measure but, again, it would take too long to\nexplain them all in the vernacular.<br>\n     Anyway, we've resumed our search for Glenn and Wattzername - in fact, I\nbelieve that is her last name, Wattzername - but we've had to keep a low\nprofile.  Our secret informants advise that that Dutch police deaf squad is\nstill cruising around town, signing obscenities at pedestrians and collecting\norders for wooden shoes.  Dirty, brutish beasts that they are, the stench of\ntheir urine in Glenn's office has barely subsided; is asparagus the only thing\nthat they eat in Dutchland?<br>\n    In keeping our low profile, we've been spending most days in a squat along\nthe south bank of the Sasquatchaqualmie River, downing brew and pretzels in\nsuper-size quantities, trolling for crappies, and rolling over the floaters\nthat drift by on the current.  Did you know that when they pop up three days or\nso afterwards, women float on their backs and men float face-down? Honest,\nninety-five times out of a hundred! Melissa Wattzername, however, could be\nexpected to float by butt up.<br>\n    The last we heard still was that Glenn and That Woman were on their way to\nLegos and were planning to build a full-size oil refinery out of those little\nplastic bricks and things; does this make any sense to you or is tat the LSD\ntalking again?. You keep writing that they were supposed to be in Nigeria. \nSomeone told me that Nigeria is just off Interstate 40 between Knoxville and\nNashville but darned if I can find it on a map! Is Nigeria closer to you or to\nme? Didn't a lander find water on NIgeria? Or was that ALgeria? Your e-mail\nsaid something garbles about them being expected at the Elko Meridian Hotel but\nwe contacted every hotel, motel, transient camp, church mission and sheriff's\nchain gang in northern Nevada without success.
