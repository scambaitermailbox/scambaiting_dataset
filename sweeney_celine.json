Of course it's your choice whom to retain as counsel, but I would be very suspicious of someone with such limited reasoning and writing skills representing himself as a London barrister. If you insist on retaining him, I will continue to deal with him, but I hope my protest is noted.<br /> <br /> \n\nRegarding your condition in the camp, obviously you have Internet access, so I didn't think it out of the question that you would also have access to a scanner and/or printer. Apparently you have neither, so I understand that you're unable to help us out with a picture.<br /> <br /> \n\nI did in fact ask your lawyer to pay the shipping charges, as you mentioned, to avoid involving the Board of Directors. If he is able to do this, I will refund him the money as soon as I receive the consignment, and the Board will not need to be involved.

I am in the middle of resolving this matter with the shipping company, so I count myself fortunate that I am not in need of your \"guarding\" or any other assistance. To paraphrase the words of the great philosopher Edmund Blackadder - it is said that intelligent dialog with learned people enriches both the mind and the soul, but personally I prefer talking to complete idiots because it reminds me that I'm best.<br /><br />\n\nSincerely<br /><br />\n\nSweeney H.
