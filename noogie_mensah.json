Lewis is so naive when it comes to money so I take care of all of his financial matters and I try not to let him get into too much trouble. That said, we have a problem here.\n\n\nAssuming that what Lewis tells me is correct, I see that you are trying to pull a simple 419 scam on him.

There is no Western Union here in Gadyukina so Lewis will have to give me the cash and send me to the Western Union office in Irkutsk. So here's the deal - I'll send you 30% of what he gives me to send to you and I'll keep 70%. Every time you ask him to send you additional money.
