Our Chief Engineer, Geordi LaForge, is counting on these modifiers to arrive prior to the installation of the subspace graviton reactor.

Mr. Zek stated that it could possibly take that long, but most likely would not.  I got the impression from him that it would be more like two or three days at the most.  I would check with your bank by Friday to see if they have anything yet.  What I sent to you was what was handed to me by Mr. Zek himself after having it stamped with his seal of approval.  The only information I gave to them was the information relayed by you.  Since there was no complete address in your information, they had to look up the complete street address of the bank and Zek stated that they needed a name on the transfer, and the only name I had was yours.  I do not think there is any cause for a red alert.  Everything went without a hitch and Mr. Zek was satisfied with all the necessary paperwork.  Even my esteemed Mr. Bok was not concerned about you receiving your funds.  I feel completely assured that you will get that which is coming to you.\n\nIf you have not heard anything from your bank by close of business day on Friday, please let me know.  I will endeavor to ascertain the status of the transfer in your stead.  I will get Data on it right away.\n\nLive long and prosper,\n\nJ.L.
