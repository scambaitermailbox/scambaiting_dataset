I realize the\nstrike and all, but we really need to get moving forward here. Hurricane season\nis rapidly approaching and I really want to break ground on my project as soon\nas possible. <br>\nThe good news is that the fine folks of North Dakota are great at hurricane\nmanagement policies and your investment will be well protected by my insurance\ncompany.\n<br><br>\nIn the meantime, I have contacted my account manager Arnold Schwarzenegger at\nthe Bank of Dummkopf in Berlin to advise that a substantial deposit is fore\ncoming. Please do not worry, I kept our deal *Top Secret* and simply told them\nI had a mutual investment partner starting a corporation. I also offered him a\nsmall percent of the deposit to help keep things under wrap \nif you know what I mean. That Arnold is quite a Terminator when it comes to\ndeals like that. It was like he was a Predator or something. Glad he is on our\nteam.<br><br>\n\nWhatever can be done to expedite the process would be greatly appreciated. My\narchitect and partner Mike Brady has a friend Sam, who is a meat cutter, and he\nemailed me that Texas Beef Futures are due for a great rise in price this fall,\nso I may have to invest elsewhere if we can't close this out. Luckily for us,\nBrady is still on vacation this week. But I know he will ask me right away when\nhe gets back what is going on.\n<br><br>\nAnxiously awaiting progress,<br><br>\n\nYours truly<br>\nPendejo Builders<br><br>\n\n(<i>Note: The faxes start rolling in, courtesy of callwave.com</i>)<br><br>\n \n <font face=\"Georgia,Arial,Verdana,sans serif\">\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "'dr.aligaruba@juno.com'", "date": "2003-07-03 12:47", "subject": "", "author_role": "bait", "body": "Dear Dr Ali,\n\nGreat News, \n\nI just got a fax from the Central Bank of Nigeria with information and such.\nI am preparing to contact a Mr. Nico Overwijn who is the Account Manager.\n\nIf there is anything else let me know.", "raw": "<hr><h3><font color=\"purple\">THE COUNT </font></h3>\n\nSent: Thursday, July 03, 2003 12:47 PM<br>\nTo: 'dr.aligaruba@juno.com'\n<br><br>\n\nDear Dr Ali,<br><br>\n\nGreat News, <br><br>\n\nI just got a fax from the Central Bank of Nigeria with information and such.\nI am preparing to contact a Mr. Nico Overwijn who is the Account Manager.\n<br><br>\nIf there is anything else let me know.<br><br>\n\n<font face=\"Georgia,Arial,Verdana,sans serif\">\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "", "author_role": "bait", "body": "Sent:\tThursday, July 03, 2003 12:56 PM\nTo:\t'ovnico@post.com'\n\n\nDr. Mr. Overwijn,\n\nGreetings and most excellent wishes to you.\n\nI thank you kindly for the fax outlining the details of our transaction.\n\nI attempted to call your number a few times, but I kept getting a weird sound\nand then disconnected. \nAre you having phone problems?\n\nAnyway, I thought that I should contact you for the final procedures.\n\nI have notified my account manager Arnold Schwarzenegger at the Bank of\nDummkopf in Berlin that we are close to completing the deal. \nSincerely,\nThe Count\nPendejo Builders", "raw": "<hr><h3><font color=\"purple\">THE COUNT </font></h3>\nSent:\tThursday, July 03, 2003 12:56 PM\nTo:\t'ovnico@post.com'\n<br><br>\n\nDr. Mr. Overwijn,<br><br>\n\nGreetings and most excellent wishes to you.<br><br>\n\nI thank you kindly for the fax outlining the details of our transaction.<br><br>\n\nI attempted to call your number a few times, but I kept getting a weird sound\nand then disconnected. <br>\nAre you having phone problems?<br><br>\n\nAnyway, I thought that I should contact you for the final procedures.<br><br>\n\nI have notified my account manager Arnold Schwarzenegger at the Bank of\nDummkopf in Berlin that we are close to completing the deal. <br><br>\nSincerely,<br>\nThe Count<br>\nPendejo Builders<br><br>\n<font face=\"Georgia,Arial,Verdana,sans serif\">\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "2003-07-03 15:16", "subject": "", "author_role": "bait", "body": "Dr. Ali,\n\nWhere are YOU???????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\n I have emailed 3 times and I got a fax about our deal and you are NO WHERE TO\nBE FOUND!!!\n\nWhat is going on?
