We are sorry to inform you that we are unable to establish that he has a WILL and as such, it is evidently clear that he left no WILL. Putting this into consideration, the fact now before us is that your relation died in-testate without a WILL. However, from our preliminary investigation, you have a genuine claim as our Law Firm has been able to establish your inheritance claim with Golf Bank Nigeria Limited at 12 Olayinka Street, off Broad Street Victoria Island, Lagos-Nigeria. Be that as it may, it will please you to know that we have concluded our verification as regards your claim to an inheritance of US$18M. Our investigation revealed, that there is indeed a deposited sum of the same mentioned amount with Golf Bank Nigeria Limited. The amount has been deposited since the year 1997 by one Mr.Thomas Mcculloch (now deceased).\nIt will also please you to know that the amount in question, has yielded reasonable interest on the principal.

According to the Director General, he was very pleased to know that the next of kin has now decided to come forward for the claim. I strongly think that I should say that you are a very lucky person, otherwise, according to him, you would have forfeited the money. You must act fast now.  \nI will need the sum of US$2,500,00 (Two thousand, five hundred United States Dollars only) to file all the necessary papers to ensure that the funds (inheritance claim) gets transferred into your nominated bank account within the next three to four working days. \n(The break down of the statutory fees of US$2,500,00 is as follows: \n(1).
