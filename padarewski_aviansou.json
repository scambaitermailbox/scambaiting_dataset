Hence You would evade consequences and I may be asked to return the whole amount of money from AFDB, when the bank or local authorities finds out that I am not the closest relative or not a relative of Markus Paderewski at all.\nIn Poland, and in all other countries that I checked it is impossible to inherit money without proving, through documents or genetic analysis, that one is a relative of the deceased testator.\n\n\n\nI haven't told You earlier, but I am an organizer of genetic examination of potential bone marrow donors in Toru\u0144, PL.
