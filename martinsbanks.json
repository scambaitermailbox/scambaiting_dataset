(SIGN HERE IMMEDIATELY UPON RECEIPT OF THIS TRAVELERS CHEQUE)  is written below the line that you have to sign on. This is very important as soon as you receive it, first thing you have to do is to sign at the top before taken to the bank at all. And it must be signed with a BLACK INK PEN.<br /><br />\n\nShould you are ask who told you to sign on the sign all you have to tell them is that the check is bought in your name so you are the purchaser and you signed on it after you have received it. Asmy client told me that he <span class=\"doh\">bought the check in your name</span> for it to be easy for you to cash without any form of delay. Please follow my instructions.\n<br /><br />\n2) On the last line on the check, you are to sign presence  of the cashier that is cashing the check for you. (COUNTERSIGN HERE IN PRESENCE OF PERSON CASHING) is written under that line. You will see it and understand better as soon as you receive the check.... This time you have to sign it when you get to the bank.\n<br /><br />\nThanks very much for the understanding and the patience so far. Now you can believe that I am serious about the business. I will await your email that you receive this instruction and you will follow it as it is very important.
