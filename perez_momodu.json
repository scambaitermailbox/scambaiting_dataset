MOMODU\n\n\n Dear Sir, Your Reply Please\n\n Dr. Augustine V. Momodu\n Federal Ministry of Sports and Youth Development,\nFederal \n Secretariate, Gariki, Abuja, Nigeria,\n\n Sir,\n\nI am  DR. AUGUSTINE V. MOMODU, I am sorry if I have intruded on your privacy I sort your permission.\n\nI was a member of the Abuja National stadium building and organizing committee of the concluded \"ALL AFRICAN GAMES\" in 2003 which was organized and hosted by Nigeria but before now I have been a director of sports in the Federal Ministry of Sports and Youth Development.\n\nWe were appointed over 3 years ago to supervise the building of the ultra modern Abuja National Stadium, putting in place all equipments needed for the completion of the stadium which is acclaimed to be one of the best in the world today and also involved in the planning and hosting of the games. This project cost the government of Nigeria Millions of dollars.\n\nThe stadium project has been completed, all equipments put in place and commissioned and used for the All African Games tagged \"ABUJA 2003\".The accounts have been rendered to the government satisfactorily and we  have received commendations for a job well done.\n\nDuring the construction, planning and execution of this project, I was able to make some money, which was kept in an escrow account set up by the government from where contractors were paid and materials purchased until the project is completed.\n\nI did this because I am not allowed by law as a civil servant to own or operate a domicilliary account in  Nigeria or any where in the world, if found out that I own or operate such an account I will be prosecuted for breach of trust and going against the civil service code of conduct. To my amazement late last year I discovered that this money has reached an astonishing amount of USD$45,000,000.00 MILLION DOLLARS.\n\nI am at a cross road now because I cannot claim this money in my name as I have declared it suppliers/contractors money while depositing it gradually,  secondly, if I turn this money in to the government I might be prosecuted for keeping such an amount without making it known in our record while rendering the account and finally, some top government officials in the presidency especially the politicians might declare it unclaimed fund and finally missing and share it amongst themselves.\n\nAlso as a civil servant my monthly take home pay after tax and other sundry deductions are at an average of between usd$550 and usd$600 meaning that all my life my salary will not give me such an amount of money.\n\nAll I want you to do is to assist me in clearing this amount from the bank while standing in as the owner and director of VACKNOL NIGERIA INTERNATIONAL LIMITED in whose name I have made the deposit.\n\nVacknol Nigeria International Limited is an international company and could have a company anywhere in the world, the most important thing is that the company is  registered here in Nigeria as a limited liability company in line with the company and allied matters decree of Nigeria which I have since done.\n\nI have also in my possession some contract document which will act as proof that VACKNOL NIGERIA INTERNATIONAL LIMITED executed the contract as a sub contractor under Julius Berger Nigeria Ltd and the Dewolfgang Gmbh who are the major contractors.\n\nOn the payment of this money to you as the supplier in the name of Vacknol Nigeria International Limited because we will apply for the transfer in this name, and you as the director of the company. I will come to meet with you in your country so that we can both sit down and discuss further what kind of business we will enter into or if need be expand your already existing business.\n\nI know you will be entitled to some percentage of this money as compensation for your efforts, Please feel free to indicate what you will take from this amount, as this is very important to us before we commence proceedings.\n\nTo enable us commence business immediately, I would need the following information from you if you agree to be my partner in this transaction:\n\n1.  Your full names and address.\n\n2.  Your Telephone numbers for easy communication.\n\n3.  Your bank names and address, account number, account name, sort code or swift code if any (this to enable the government authorities approve the receiving bank)\n\nI will tell you more about this when I hear from you. I will give you every detail of what we are to do. I want to assure you my dear friend that with your cooperation and understanding the sky will be our limit. Please do contact me immediately.\n\n Regards.\n\n DR. AUGUSTINE V.

I do not know why you are finding it difficult to send the money to the attorney to enable his chamber represent us well in the release and transfer of this $45million into your account.<br><br>\n\nI am really in in a fix as you are not acting fast.\n<br><br>\nYou remember I notified you about this attorney's representation fees for the legal documents in the begining and I asked you if you will be capable, you confirmed to me that you will be capable to handle this hence i continue the processing and paid over $16,000.00 to get the contract documents in your name which I have sent to you.\n<br><br>\nSo my Dear Juan, please do not disappoint me as I will be finished in life.  I depend in this transaction as all is ready for the money to be transfered into your.  The only thing that is holding the authorities in transfering this contract money is the attorney getting this legal documents and signing them in your behalf.<br><br>\n\nPlease do fast my Dear Juan and send the $2,350.00 to the attorney this week  and let me know when next week you will come.  BUT IF YOU FEEL THAT YOU CAN LONGER COME DUE TO COST OR OTHER THINGS, WRITE TO THE ATTORNEY - BARRISTER KOLADE THOMAS TO REPRESENT YOU IN THE SIGNING AND INFORM ME SO THAT I CAN BE THERE TO WITNESS THE SIGNING CEREMONEY TO MAKE SURE THAT NOTHING IS LEFT.\n<br><br>\nI am waiting for your mail today please.<br><br>\n\nI wish you all the best and God's protection.<br><br>\n\nDr. Momodu\n\n</span>\n<br><br>\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "2005-08-16 00:00", "subject": "Wish me luck", "author_role": "bait", "body": "Dear Victor,\n\nYesterday I had my last final examination for the\nyear.
