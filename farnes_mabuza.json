The banking law and guidelines here stipulate that if such money remained unclaimed after four years,the money will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed funds. The request for a foreigner as a relative for this claim is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a South African cannot claim this fund as next of kin. We agreed that 20% of this money will go to the foreign partner who will supply the foreign account,5% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the transaction and 75% will be for me and my colleagues.Thereafter,l and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement of the percentages as indicated above.

I am delighted to inform you that I shall be flying to South Africa on Wednesday to deliver an address to the International Congress of Merchant Bankers in Cape Town. I was not planning to attend but my old friend Professor Jose Mourinho of the University of Lison, Portugal is unwell and I have been asked to step into the breach.<br><br>\n\nTherefore I suggest that we meet and I can pay you these fees in cash which will be of mutual benefit. I can meet you in Cape Town on Wednesday evening or in Durban on Friday or Johannesburg next Saturday [27 November].\n<br><br>\nWould you prefer US dollars as opposed to sterling ?<br><br>\n\nYours sincerely,<br><br>\n\n\nSir Charles Farnes-Barnes VC BSc [Economics]<br><br>\n\n\n\n<i>Surprisingly he seems to have taken the bait as my next e-mail will show</i><br><br>\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "2004-11-19 07:30", "subject": "", "author_role": "scam", "body": "ATTN:Sir Charles Farnes-Barnes,\n\nI RECEIVED YOUR MAIL AND I WILL BE GLAD TO MEET YOU WHEN YOU ARRIVE HERE IN SOUTH AFRICA.I WILL LIKE US TO MEET IN JOHANNESBURG AS YOU SAID.
