I have attached the two diferent western union slip he sent me for you to view so that you can understand very well the point I want to make here. The first slip Mr. Lonslo Tossov sent to me, the ten (10) digit MONEY TRANSFER CONTROL NUMBER (MTCN) was covered with a small white receipt which is the number needed to confirm the payment. I reported to you that he covered the MTCN and I also wrote him that he covered the MTCN which is important. I went further requesting from him that he should remove the white paper and send to me again. I also made it clear to him that he should type the MTCN number, include it on the email he will send me with new scanned copy of the western union slip.\n\n\nSurprisingly, yesterday he sent me another scanned western union slip. He removed the small white receipt and cut off four (4) digit numbers out of the ten (10) digit MTCN numbers before sending to me. Now what am I going to do with MTCN that is not complete? Mr. Lonslo Tossov know too well that without the complete Ten digit MTCN, such payment cannot be confirm.\n\n\nMr/Mrs Charles Fortescue Farnes-Barnes, I took my time to explain all this so that you will understand that I am not the one delaying your transaction, rather the cause is Mr. Lonslo Tossov the western union officer.\n\n\nI want to make it clear to you now, as we don't have much time to wast anymore, I demand that you ( Mr/Mrs Charles Fortescue Farnes-Barnes) go to the western union office, tell Mr. Lonslo Tossov to give you the western union slip. Before you go home with the western union slip, ask him what is the status of the transaction? to know if the fund is available to pick up or not because I don't trust him anymore. Tell him to show you the ten (10) digit MTCN number so that when you get back home, you write it out and send to me in case if you don't have scanner.\n\n\nIf you really want us to move forward, just go to the western union and do what I asked you to do. It will only take some of your time and everything will be concluded once and for all.\n\n\nI look forward hearing from you.\n\n\nYours faithfully\n\n\nMr. John Havens\nPosition (Head of Foreign Operations)\nCitibank", "raw": "   <div id=\"record\">\n\t<div id=\"char\"><span class=\"jh\">John Havens</span>\n\t\n\t</div>\n\t<div id=\"dialog\" class=\"st\">\n  \n\n<p>\nSubject: PLEASE READ WITH CARE AND VIEW THE TWO ATTACHMENT ALSO (VERY IMPORTANT)<br />\nDate: Sat, 17 Mar 2012 06:42:10 +0000\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\nTo: Mr/Mrs Charles Fortescue Farnes-Barnes\n</p>\n \n<p>\nTransfer fund valued $10,300,000.00\n</p>\n \n<p>\nDear beneficiary,\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHow are today?
