It contains legal documents which would have transfered the bulk of the estate's wealth to a Mr Larry Smith if the paperwork had been signed.  Evidently Robb died before getting Lady Matilda's required signature.  We also have forensics examining emails on Robb's laptop computer.  Luckily for us Jeeves wasn't his usual efficient self this time.\"   \nBilko was referring to two previous tragedies at 100 Beacon Hill.

Both deaths were eventually deemed natural, but the demise of Robb raises nagging suspicions. Police had combed the death scenes, but were foiled by Jeeves.
