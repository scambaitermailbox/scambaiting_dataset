We arrived back in Hawaii and Gilligan was so\nglad to be back that he actually peed his pants.  We all mourn the loss of\nGinger.  It was a bit difficult explaining to Hawaii 5-0 that we had to kill\nand eat her.  Mary Ann and I are living together in a small hut on the North\nShore.  She surfs the big ones daily and I am looking for a new boat to\nskipper.  Due to our newfound celebrity Martha Stewart came over and did the\ndecorating for the hut.  She seems to like the orange color a lot right now. \nIt also seems a bit austere.  I hope it is only a phase.  I was going to get on\nas the captain of a Japanese fishing boat but before they returned the U.S.\nNavy hit and sunk them with a submarine.  It is a good thing that our insurance\nclaim on the minnow came through and we now have a couple of million dollars to\nlive on.  But don't worry we could all use a little more so lets do the deal.\n\n  <br><br>\n\nThe professor is now working for Betty Crocker at a laboratory.  Oh the things\nhe can do with a coconut.  Mr. and Mrs Howell have purchased a country club and\ngolf course.

The whole gang of Gilligan's Island is most\ndisappointed.  They were going to name their new boat the 419 in honor of Mr.\nQin.  Feel free to write Mr. Qin if you wish.  I am sure that he is having a\nwonderful time.</i>\n\n <br><br>\n\n<font size=+2><font color=\"red\">Wang Qin &lt;wangqinhk@cosmo.com&gt;</font></font>\n\n <br><br>\n\n", "comments": []}]}
