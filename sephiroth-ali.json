My name is MR BABU ALI. i am from Burkina Faso born and bread in Republic of Gabon, I am formal Director BICIG bank of Gabon and also Financial Adviser to the late richest and longest Africa President Omar Bongo. Presently i work with BANK OF AFRICA ECOWAS as telex managing Director. I do not know whether this is your correct email address or not because I only used your name initials to search for your contact.In case you are not the person I am supposed to contact, please see this as a confidential message and do not reveal it to another person and if you are not the intended receiver, do let me know whether you can be of assistance regarding my proposal below because it is top secret and a fast rewarding deal and you will discover it as soon as we proceed. \n\n\nI am about to retire from active Bank service to start a new life but I am sceptical to reveal this particular secret to a stranger and I hope that you will not expose or betray this trust and confident that i am about to establish with you for the mutual benefit of our families. You must assure me that everything will be handled confidentially.It has been 10 years now that most of the greedy African Politicians used our bank to transfer money overseas through the help of their Political advisers. Most of the funds which they transferred out of the shores of Africa was gold and oil money that was supposed to have been used to develop the continent. Their Political advisers always inflated the amounts before transfer to foreign accounts so I also used the opportunity to divert part of the funds hence I am aware that there is no official trace of how much was transferred as all the accounts used for such transfers were being closed after transfer.I worked as personal Bank Officer to most of the politicians and when I discovered that they were using me to succeed in their greedy act, I also cleaned some of their banking records from the Bank files and no one cared to ask me because the money was too much for them to control. They laundered over $700,000,000,00(seven hundred million) united states Dollars oil and Gold money during the process. As I am sending this message to you, I was able to divert Eight Million Five hundred Thousand American Dollars ($8.5 m) to an escrow account belonging to no one in the bank. The bank is anxious now to know who is the beneficiary to the funds because they have made a lot of profits with the funds.It is more than Eight years now and most of the politicians are no longer using our bank to transfer funds overseas. The Eight Million Five hundred Thousand Dollars has been lying waste but I don't want to retire from the bank without transferring the funds to a foreigner who has account, to enable me share the profits/percentage with the receiver. The money will be shared 60% for me and 40% for you.\n\n\nThere is no one coming to ask you about the funds because President Omar Bongo is dead and i am the only person who knows about this money. I secured everything with original document to back you up when you declare your interest. I only want you to assist me by providing a bank account where the funds can be transferred, You are only required to act on my behalf from there by following my advice because i will be giving you information from time to time concerning bank decisions towards this transfer as soon as you apply in the bank here as the beneficiary of this fund. You are not to face any difficulties or legal implications as everything will be done ok with legitimate Documents and right which can protect us against any breach of law between your Government and my. If you are capable of receiving the funds, do let me know immediately to enable me give you a detailed information on what to do.For me, I have not stolen the money from anyone because the other people that took the whole money did not face any problems. This is my chance also to grab my own but you must keep the details of the funds secret to avoid leakages as no one in the bank knows about the rightful beneficiary.I expect your urgent communication. Upon your response and strong assurance that you will not let me down when this fund gets into your Bank Account, as soon as you declare your interest I will let you know what to do and the transfer procedures without delay.For more details call me with this telephone line +226-75874689, Millions of thanks and abundant blessings to you and to your entire family in this year 2011.(FILL THE FORM BELLOW AND SEND IT BACK TO ME).\n\n\n1) Your Full Name: \n2) Your Age: \n3) Marital Status: \n4) Your Cell Phone Number: \n5) Your Country: \n6) Your Occupation: \n7)Sex: \n8)Your Religion:\n\n\nYours Sincerely, \nMR BABU ALI.", "raw": " <div id=\"record\">\n\t<div id=\"char\"><span class=\"ba\">MR BABU ALI</span>\n<p class=\"date\">1st December 2010</p>\n\n<p class=\"comment\">A variation on the <a href=\"bankcustomer.html\">DEAD BANK CUSTOMER</a> format.

Thankfully my condition has eased off a little since President Bongo, is now not feeling so angered. I have decided to travel directly to Burkina Faso to pay the costs in person and was perhaps looking for advice on flights and hotels.
