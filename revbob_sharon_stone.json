Poor Mr and Mrs Malone suffered the grievous loss of their daughter Molly.  She was out with the family seafood wheelbarrow when it broke away and careered down the street.  She tried her best but was unable to stop it and it was totally destroyed and her entire stock of cockles and mussels was lost.  In her shame she died of a fever and no one could save her and that was the end of sweet Molly Malone.  I do hope that your brother Peter is not about to follow in her footsteps.\n\nSome good news for you.  Your application has been considered and you have provisional acceptance for conversion to The One True Talismanic Yearning and been granted status as Grade 6 Totty. Congratulations!!\n\nFor the final stage of the acceptance you need to complete two simple tasks.\n1. Choose your 'handle' name, remember that I asked you to do this in my last message\n2. Send us a photograph of yourself holding a sign on which you have written in black letters 'BLESSED BEEHIVE BUZZ BUZZ GRADE 6 TOTTY'.  The sign needs to be large enough for the words to be read in the photo.  The photo will be put on your identity card which we will then send you with enough funds for you to buy your airline ticket to the USA.\n\nAs for your brother Peter I do hope that he lasts out, infernal bleeding can be so difficult.  We have been holding a prayer vigil for him and on Sunday Sister Bridget went into Holy Rapture whilst thinking of your brother lying all alone on his bed.  To be honest Sister Bridget has not been quite the same since and has spent most of her time in the candle repository moaning and groaning.  We're sure the spirit is inside her so please do tell that we're all praying that you both get what you deserve.\n\nWith regard to the information you requested please note that it has not changed since I last sent the details to you.
