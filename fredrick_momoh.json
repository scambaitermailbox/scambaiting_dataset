Of course, if you did some checking you would realise \n                that the receipt I sent you was false.</li>\n            </ul>\n            <p></p>\n            <p>Some words of advice: Please try to make your stupid storied more \n              believable. Also, try to use different types of stories. This year \n              alone I have received hundreds SCAM letters, and nearly all of then \n              use the same basic story line Do you guys make any money out of \n              this? If you do, then I urge you to spend some of your stolen money \n              and find someone who can write more convincing stories.</p>\n            <p>Also, your partners who pretend to be a bank; All their letters \n              are full of spelling and grammar errors, and also the way they write \n              is COMPLETELY WRONG for a bank/banker. Advise them that they need \n              more lessons in ecommerce</p>\n            <p>Also, WHY DO YOU PEOPLE ALWAYS WRITE IN UPPERCASE LIKE THIS? Only \n              junior boys write like that. As soon as I see people writing all \n              their letters IN UPPERCASE LIKE THIS I know immediately that they \n              are scammers.</p>\n            <p>Please do not write back to me with your pitiful excuses. I have \n              heard all the excuses and stories. Of course, you will probably \n              write back to me to tell me your 'deal' is true, like so many many \n              others of your type of people have done with me in the past. My \n              advice: DON'T EVEN BOTHER. I will simply not believe a single word \n              you say.</p>\n            <p>Also, a good trick that mugu's like you like to use is the story \n              that &quot;I knew you were false all the time&quot;. Of course this \n              is COMPLETE RUBBISH!</p>\n            <p>&nbsp;</p>\n            <p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p>\n            <p align=\"left\"><b>To date, no reply!</b></p>\n            <p align=\"center\">&nbsp;</p>\n            <p align=\"center\"><b><a href=\"donations.htm\">A note from the webmaster</a></b></p>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n      </table>\n", "to_name": "", "subject": "", "from_name": ""}]}
