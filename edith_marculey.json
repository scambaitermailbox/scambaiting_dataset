Thanks for the nice photograph. For the past \n              couple of weeks your picture has been displayed on my anti-scam \n              website, where thousands of people have been taking a good luck \n              at your mugu face!</p>\n            <p align=\"left\">The passport I sent you was a forgery, and the same \n              applies to the flight booking slip as well. </p>\n            <p align=\"left\">Of course, perhaps you paid some ugly whore to pose \n              for the picture, but that does not matter. Your time and hopes were \n              wasted, whilst all the time you thought you were going to steal \n              &pound;15,000 from me!</p>\n            <p align=\"left\">By the way, I thought you might enjoy the picture \n              below. Perhaps it may be a good idea to print it out and frame it, \n              so that you have something to remember me by!</p>\n            <p align=\"left\">PLEASE do not bother to waste your time to try to \n              convince me your offer was real. I am an expert in 419 scams and \n              that is exactly what you were trying to pull. Sadly I see many thousands \n              of emails like yours every year. So far this year I have made a \n              fool out of over 60 other thieves like you, in just the same manner. \n              Yes, they were dumb enough to send in stupid pictures as well!</p>\n            <p align=\"left\">Bye for now.</p>\n            <p align=\"left\">Shiver Metimbers.</p>\n            <p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p>\n            <p align=\"center\"><img src=\"../images/edith_marculey2.jpg\" width=\"494\" height=\"623\" border=\"2\"></p>\n            <p align=\"left\"><br>\n            </p>\n            <p align=\"center\"><br>\n              <b>ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST.</b></p>\n            <p align=\"center\">&nbsp;</p>\n            <p align=\"center\"><b><a href=\"donations.htm\">A note from the webmaster</a></b></p>\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n      </table>\n", "from_name": ""}], "title": "EDITH HAS A FETISH", "baiter": "SHIVER METIMBERS", "location": null, "notes": ["[Damn this scammer is fast!]", "[Of course I reply immediately!]", "[True to her word - which I admit is unusual for a scammer - the picture arrives]", "[Damn!
