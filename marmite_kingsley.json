I have the pleasure to share my testimony with you,\nhaving seen your contact from the Internet.\n\nI am Mr. Frank Kingsley, personal assistant to late Mr. and Mrs.\nWilliams, a British couple that lived in my Country for 25 years before\nthey both died in a car accident late last year.\n\nThese couples were good Christians, they were so dedicated to God but\nthey had no child till they died. Throughout their stay in my country,\nthey acquired a lot of properties like lands, house properties, etc.  As\nthe assistance before their death, the husband Mr. Williams instructed\nhis British lawyer to write his WILL. Because they had no child, they\ndedicated their wealth to God. According to the WILL, the properties\nhave to be sold and the money be given out to a ministry in Europe, Asia\nand America for the work of God. As their personal assistant, copies of\nsome of the documents for the properties were in my care while original\ncopies where in the custody of the attorney. He gave me the authority\nto sell the properties while we give out the fund to the Ministries for\nthe work of God and to the less privileged.\n\nTo cut the story short, we sold all the properties after their death, as\ninstructed by my boss, Mr. Williams before his death. And as matter of\nfact, after we sold all their properties, expectedly realized a huge\namount of money that runs into millions of dollars, and what supposed to\nbe his percentage interest of his right legal fee was firstly deducted\nout of the total amount realized from the sold properties, this was\nbased on the initial agreement between him and the Owner of the\nproperties before his death. Therefore, the total amount left to be\ninvested into God's work as instructed by the owner is $12,500,000.00 (twelve\nmillion, five hundred thousand US dollars) only. But Instead of giving\nthe main fund out for the work of God as instructed to us by my boss\nbefore his death. We converted the fund to ourselves with the intention\nof investing the fund abroad for our personal use.\n\nI was afraid of putting the fund in our local Bank here due to the\nrecent probe on bank accounts, because I have to give account to the\nbank on how I got the money. I had encounter with Christ when Pastor\nJeremiah was preaching on television concerning Ananias and Sapphire in\nActs 5:1-11. After hearing the word of God, I gave my life to Christ and\nbecame a born again Christian. As a born again Christian, I started\nreading my bible and one day, the Lord opened my eyes to Ezekiel 33: 18\nand 19. From the scripture, I discovered that the only way I could have\npeace in my life is to do what\nis lawful and right by giving out the fund as instructed for the work of\nGod by my Boss.\nI have asked God for forgiveness on my initial thought concerning the\nmoney, and I know that God have forgiven me. But I have to do what is\nlawful and right in the sight of God by giving out the fund to the\nchosen ministry abroad for the purpose of God's work as instructed by my\nboss before his death. After my prayers, I asked God to make his choice\nand direct me to an honest Christian that deserves this fund by his\nGrace.
