Very kind from her. This matter is closed now and I am on my way to the bank.\n\n\nBefore leaving office, I have a personal request. You know, I am a busy person, 56 years old and due my hard working my ex wife has left me 2 years ago. Now I realise that I had to spend more time with her. In the meantime she is married again to another man so it is too late now.\n\n\nBut maybe you could check if Ijeoma Orji is a single woman for me? Maybe she is! Maybe she is open to know someone. As I am planning to travel to Nigeria in a couple of months, maybe I could invite her for a dinner?\n\n\nBut I won't do any move before knowing if she is married or not...so maybe you with your connexions, you could check that for me? The Human Resources Dept. from the bank will certainly have access to her file.\n\n\nI know it sounds strange and crazy, but I am a man looking for love, like every other man.

It is more than just a social union or legal contract between people that creates kinship. It is an institution in which interpersonal relationships, usually intimate and sexual, are acknowledged in a variety of ways, depending on the culture or subculture in which it is found, but based on LOVE between 2 persons. Such a union, often formalized via a wedding ceremony, may also be called matrimony.\n\n\nPeople marry for many reasons, including one or more of the following: legal, social, libido, emotional, economic, spiritual, and religious...but only LOVE counts.\n\n\nI don't know if I was clear enough, but it is really how I think about marriage.
