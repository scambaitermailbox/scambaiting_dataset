Fine by me!<br>\nI was once a Captain in the United States Marine Corps. <br>\nI commanded a company of Marine riflemen - seven officers and 161 enlisted men. <br>\nThen I commanded a squadron of helicopter gunships - twelve AH-1 Cobras, 200 plus personnel, and tens of millions of dollars of sophisticated hardware. <br>\nMy personal tally of kills during Operation Desert Saber was nine MBTs, 22 other AFVs, 72 soft-skinned vehicles, 10 AAA positions and 19 hardpoints. <br>\nI had to stand by helpless as corpsmen tried to save the sight of my weapons officer after our Cobra was hit by a 57 mm shell. <br>\nIn Somalia, I was again on infantry duties; I personally killed eleven members of criminal gangs, and was wounded in action. <br>\nNow, in my civilian career, I'm creating a company that will hopefully bring the latest in high-tech transport to a remote area, with all that it means for emergency services and the future of tourism. \nYou, on the other hand, are some pissant little ambulance chaser who dissed me from the git-go, and now you flash your gorram religion - whatever the hell a \"dicken\" is - the way a Vegas dancer shakes her ass.
