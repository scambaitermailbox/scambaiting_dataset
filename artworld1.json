The MINIMUM completed picture size must be 14 by 14 inches, however \n              as long as they are bigger than this they can be any size your artists \n              prefers.<br>\n              2.

You will see that the \n              attached picture has many small details. Ensure your artist is made \n              aware that he must attempt to capture as much detail as possible.<br>\n              <br>\n              You may tell your artist that the picture can be painted on any \n              type of surface, such as paper or canvas. Please bear in mind that \n              the artwork will have to be shipped to us for inspection before \n              the donation payment is given, so obviously you must take into consideration \n              the weight of the artwork so that the shipping cost is not too high \n              for you.<br>\n              <br>\n              On receipt of satisfactory artwork we will then judge the skill \n              level of the artists submission and will reward him/her with a monetary \n              donation depending of their skill. As mentioned previously, the \n              minimum donation amount per artist is $20,000 but this can rise \n              up to $150,000 per artist depending on their skill. Note that my \n              board members will usually pay higher amounts for paintings rather \n              than drawings. Donation payments are usually given within 24 hours \n              of receiving the artwork. <br>\n              <br>\n              Note that as a precaution, all received artwork is carefully checked \n              to ensure that the artists have not used methods such as tracing \n              etc. to create their work.

Please ensure you always quote this number on\nall future correspondence so that we can deal with your emails more\nefficiently.\n\nPlease find attached to this email the sample image. Give a copy\nof this to your artist to reproduce. Each image we send has been\nspecially selected to show off various skills of your artists. If\nyou have more artists willing to submit their work, please let me\nknow and I will forward some other sample images. Please note the\nfollowing rules:\n\n1. The MINIMUM completed picture size must be 14 by 14 inches, however\nas long as they are bigger than this they can be any size your artists\nprefers.\n2. The painting or drawing must be in COLOUR\n3. The painting/drawing must be the artists own work by hand and\nNOT traced in any way.\n\nAttention to detail is extremely important and will help my board\nmembers to judge the skill of the artists. You will see that the\nattached picture has many small details. Ensure your artist is made\naware that he must attempt to capture as much detail as possible.\n\nYou may tell your artist that the picture can be painted on any\ntype of surface, such as paper or canvas. Please bear in mind that\nthe artwork will have to be shipped to us for inspection before\nthe donation payment is given, so obviously you must take into consideration\nthe weight of the artwork so that the shipping cost is not too high\nfor you.\n\nOn receipt of satisfactory artwork we will then judge the skill\nlevel of the artists submission and will reward him/her with a monetary\ndonation depending of their skill. As mentioned previously, the\nminimum donation amount per artist is $20,000 but this can rise\nup to $150,000 per artist depending on their skill. Note that my\nboard members will usually pay higher amounts for paintings rather\nthan drawings. Donation payments are usually given within 24 hours\nof receiving the artwork.\n\nNote that as a precaution, all received artwork is carefully checked\nto ensure that the artists have not used methods such as tracing\netc. to create their work.
