I want to find out how this is possible, seeing there is obviously somebody out there playing a dirty game which could ruin my reputation. Before I do anything I want to know the facts and you better find out what is going on. What's the problem with your boss anyway? It must be in his interest that I do business with his bank so he better present the facts. Or is he trying to hide something?\n<br /><br />\nEither you find out what the heck is going on or I'll have to talk to the guys at the Nigerian embassy on Monday. Your boss will probably not be pleased about the latter, so I guess your choice will be finally acting professionally and present me the files I want. You can attach them to an email. If you do so, please be sure to send them to my second account xxxx@xxxxxx.xx, seeing xxxxxxxx has a very limited amount of storage space.\n<br /><br />\nAfter you and I nail those criminals I guess it will be safe to proceed with the business.
