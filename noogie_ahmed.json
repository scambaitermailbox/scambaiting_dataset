I'm\nglad to finally meet you.\n\nBefore we go further I do have some questions regarding this\ntransaction:\n\n1. I must admit I don't understand the necessity of court involvement.\nMr. Camara is the legal owner of this consignment and it would appear to\nme that any transfer of ownership would be strictly between Mr. Camara\nand the security company. I would be very appreciative if you could\nexplain the necessity of a court hearing. It seems like a completely\nunnecessary expense.\n\n2.

Got a lot to get done today.<br><br>\n\nAmed, my brother, we better get something straight right now. There is\nno way that a passport is going to cost $405! No Way! If a passport cost\nthat much, nobody would own one. Give me a break, Amed.<br><br>\n\nLook, I don't mind you trying to hose me a liitle bit on some of these\ncosts, but let's not get carried away. It's the same thing with this\nwork permit thing. You and I both know that they don't cost $170. It's\nthe same situation - if they cost that much, nobody would have one.<br><br>\n\nMy secretary Wanda is setting up flights and hotel for Oxnard to come\ndown there. I don't know how far along they are with arrangements\nbecause they're not here in the hotel today. I've given Wanda your email\naddress and told her to let you know in case I'm not back. By the way,\nshe knows nothing about our transaction.<br><br>\n\nI'll contact you when I get back.<br><br>\n\nLewd<br><br>\n\n[<i>What does it take to scrape this barrister off???</i>]<br><br>\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "2004-12-26 12:43", "subject": "", "author_role": "scam", "body": "Dear Mr Lewis\n\nFirst of all i wish you happy christmas;\n\nSo my friend if your reprentative comes and pay me my consultation fee\nand i will give him receipt so that she will sign her part.you said your\npartner send your unkown telephone number why cant you call me;i have\ntry so many times to call your so contact that you are proud that is in\nmy office and dont have any good responds that you are the real owner of\nthe number that you are claiming to be yours.\n\ngive your representative my telephone number to call me when she will\narrive dakar \nhoping to serve your representative better. \n\nHon.Barrister lamine diop LLC .............................", "raw": "<hr><b><font color=\"brown\"><i>LAMINE DIOP</i></font></b><br><br>\n\n\n\nSent : Sunday, December 26, 2004 12:43 PM \n<br><br>\n\nDear Mr Lewis<br><br>\n\nFirst of all i wish you happy christmas;\n<br><br>\nSo my friend if your reprentative comes and pay me my consultation fee\nand i will give him receipt so that she will sign her part.you said your\npartner send your unkown telephone number why cant you call me;i have\ntry so many times to call your so contact that you are proud that is in\nmy office and dont have any good responds that you are the real owner of\nthe number that you are claiming to be yours.<br><br>\n\ngive your representative my telephone number to call me when she will\narrive dakar <br>\nhoping to serve your representative better. <br><br>\n\nHon.Barrister lamine diop LLC .............................<br><br>\n\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "2004-12-26 00:00", "subject": "", "author_role": "bait", "body": "Barrister Ipod,\n\nYou are one of the most exasperating individuals I've ever had the\npleasure of dealing with.\n\nLet me explain this one more time - we can't use your help.
