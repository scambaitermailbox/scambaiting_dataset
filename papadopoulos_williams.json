I did receive your today's mail\ninformations with contents carefully noted. \nFirstly,regarding to the proof you are demanding from\nMr.Newmann, i.e. picture showing that the said 3\nconsignment was really deposited with their\ncompany,Has to mean you never trusted my good\nperson???I required an answer.ok.  Today i contacted\nthe security company in Holland via Phone for further\nexplaination in regards.  Dear George,I most state\ncatigorically to you that such demand by you shows\nabsolutely distrust on my very person because i have\nalready forwarded to you all the proof/ documents\nconcerning the intended business,my personal\npicture,social security number was previousely\nforwarde to you during inception to this transaction. \nI did earlier advised you to be friendly with\nMr.Newmann in past and recent time with an\nexplaination to you that he was only trying to assist\nus, but you never adhered to my advise, Well,it is\nmost unfortunate my good friend MR.GEORGE. \nHowever,base on my experince and good understanding\nthere is no manner with which mr.Newmann can met such\ndemand of yours and to be frankly with you it is not\nobtainable in any where in the world,confidently you\nknows it,  furthermore,Mr.Newmann and the general\nmanager of their instituation whom i spoke with on\nphone today put it clear to me that your demand is\nquite impossible and against ethics and previlledge of\nevery global banking,they finally advised that the\nonly solution is for you to arrange the said charges\nfee in cash and come over to their office in\nNertherland for your official claiming of your\nconsignment.  In conclusion,I personally advise you as\nmatter of fact to get yourself prepared and travel to\nHolland, while myself will arrange for my assoiate\nattorney Mr.J.Mbenga for a speedy conclusion of this\ntransaction because i would like everything to be\ncompleted latest this weekend.  so what you have to do\nnow is to contact the security company immediately and\nschedule an appointment date with them over your\ncoming to claim our consignment because it belong to\nme and you,as soon you write to them, please do get\nback to me.  Finally,much argument is never at this\nstage is never to our both benefit,i am the person you\nare to beleive and trust.
