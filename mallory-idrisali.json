I shall take them \n \nbefore the Committee myself, and will speak on your behalf.  You should\nhear from us within the \n \nweek. <br><br>\n \nAs to your religious concerns -- you need have none.  We here at the\nDepartment treat our \n \nsupernatural investigations in a purely scientific manner -- as we say,\nwe are keen to probe the \n \noccult, but not pat it on the head, read its pamphlets, or get into long\nconversations with it.  <br><br>\n \nJust ask Dr. Spengler -- he has trapped over two dozen actuallized\nectoplasmic free-roaming \n \nvapors, but the man still doesn't believe in ghosts! <br><br>\n \nHere are the papers, Dr. Ali.

The meeting with the Applications Committee, which was\nrescheduled for this \n \nafternoon since the power was out in Lovecraft Hall, has just been\ncanceled.  It seems two of \n \nthe Committee couldn't attend after the rescheduling, so we're off the\nhook until Monday! \n \nI feel confident that I can procure funding approval.  Still, any\nelaboration you can provide on \n \nthe nature of the Sagumu Road site will be helpful.  \n \n \nWe are off to investigate an alleged haunting in Mordibund Manor this\nweekend.  Dr. Spengler is \n \nsure his readings in the so-called Bloody Basement, taken just last\nmonth, indicate a bi-polar \n \nlunar reciprocating spectre, possibly accompanied by at least two\nlow-level thermal poltergeist \n \nnexi.  You can imagine our excitement, as a fellow student of the\nsupernatural.  Mordibund Manor \n \npromises to exceed even the Amityville Apartment 3-G site for arcane\ninfestation, and I don't \n \nneed to tell you how many deep-reach IR cameras we ruined there! \n \n \nSo bear with us, dear sir, until Monday.  And if you send anything\nfurther in the meantime, it \n \nwill only serve to cement your funding.  I did neglect to mention before\nthat you could toss in \n \na bit of jargon, just to let the Committee know you know your way around\na three-phase proton \n \naccelerator and a magnetic spectral containment toroid.  By the way, do\nyou have access to any \n \nmodern ectoplasmic technology?  We could always throw in a few pieces of\ngear along with the \n \ngrant -- call it an intra-University loan, and the Bursar won't even\nblink.  It's old stuff, but \n \nit still works -- they built the contacts with solid gold, back in the\nEighties (heck, there's \n \ntwo pounds of purest gold alone in the primary emission chamber of a\nHawkins H5!). \n \n  \n \nAnyway, let me know.

The meeting with the Applications Committee, which was\nrescheduled for this \n \nafternoon since the power was out in Lovecraft Hall, has just been\ncanceled.  It seems two of \n \nthe Committee couldn't attend after the rescheduling, so we're off the\nhook until Monday! <br><br>\n \nI feel confident that I can procure funding approval.  Still, any\nelaboration you can provide on \n \nthe nature of the Sagumu Road site will be helpful.  <br><br>\n \n \nWe are off to investigate an alleged haunting in Mordibund Manor this\nweekend.  Dr. Spengler is \n \nsure his readings in the so-called Bloody Basement, taken just last\nmonth, indicate a bi-polar \n \nlunar reciprocating spectre, possibly accompanied by at least two\nlow-level thermal poltergeist \n \nnexi.  You can imagine our excitement, as a fellow student of the\nsupernatural.  Mordibund Manor \n \npromises to exceed even the Amityville Apartment 3-G site for arcane\ninfestation, and I don't \n \nneed to tell you how many deep-reach IR cameras we ruined there! <br><br>\n \n \nSo bear with us, dear sir, until Monday.  And if you send anything\nfurther in the meantime, it \n \nwill only serve to cement your funding.  I did neglect to mention before\nthat you could toss in \n \na bit of jargon, just to let the Committee know you know your way around\na three-phase proton \n \naccelerator and a magnetic spectral containment toroid.  By the way, do\nyou have access to any \n \nmodern ectoplasmic technology?  We could always throw in a few pieces of\ngear along with the \n \ngrant -- call it an intra-University loan, and the Bursar won't even\nblink.
