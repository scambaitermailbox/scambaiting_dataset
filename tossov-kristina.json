Working day and night in my wooden production annexe has produced a wonderful product, but on the cusp of success it seems I am thwarted and I find it all so depressing.

I do occasionally take a trip to the Merkin Peninsula, to catch the sea breeze, but this is a couple of hours' drive and even this sort of excursion is rare, as I have to be careful in case the flange jell overcooks back at base. I cannot always rely upon the good graces of Todger to keep the Jell lubricating in my absence! Yes, we do indeed have a strong tourist trade in SA, but not so much in this particular part of the country.

I must admit that I was a little concerned less my previous frankness had meant that you were put off further communication with me, but I felt it wise and right to be just as honest and forthcoming as you. It is hard, opening up to a stranger but already I feel a growing warmth between us. And don't worry about the delay in response. I, too have other things to attend to which keep me away from the computer. The days and nights tending the flange jell vat is a prime example; you can imagine the heat and perspiration which together go into every single sample batch created in the production annex there at the bottom of my garden - and yet each time I feel I am but a small step from perfection!
