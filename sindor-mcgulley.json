He's not a nice person.\n\n\nEnjoy !\n\n\nThis bait's nearly two year run provided me endless opportunities to try out things I've learned. The lad would disappear, usually when things had gone to a place he didn't care for, and then he would come back months later. In this one string of off-and-on baiting I was able to try my hand at:\n\n\n-          Bank account closures (3 total)\n-          Multiple characters (one is more of a criminal than the lad)\n-          Two \"dolla chops\", one really big one\n-          Multiple lads using the same account, allowing me to confuse several at a time\n-          Lad abuse (following the \"the lad is always wrong\" rule)\n-          Full on, ear-blazing, profane rage\n\n\nThroughout this whole adventure, I used only one email address (except for the nasty language at the end, but that was really fun... you'll see). It appears that one lad started, then left, and a second lad dove in... and left... and then the original lad came back... and left... and then a NEW lad took the abusive ending. And ALL of them were corresponding from the same character and email account (except when they added MORE accounts and started sending up to 11 copies of everything).\n\nAmazing.", "ADDRESS --------  NIGERIA\nTEXT QUESTION ----- GOD", "AMOUNT----------$150D\n\n\nMY TRIP WILL BE BY  WEEKEND AND I EXPECT YOU TO COMPLY BEFORE THEN SO THAT THE DELIVERY CAN BE COMPLETED.

If your English is not good enough for this to make sense to you, find someone else who can help you. I promise that you will both be very rich.\n\n\nI am Lou's son-in-law and he's asked me to help him. It is important that you realize that he trusts me and will most certainly follow any instructions that I give him.\n\n\nFirst, let us get past the obvious. You are not an ambassador and there is no money for you to send to Lou. You are one of many thousands of Nigerian criminals sitting in cafes attempting to steal from unsuspecting fools. I know your 419 game, so please don't insult me by insisting that this is all \"real\". It's a scam and it's bullshit and we both know it.\n\n\nNow that we both know who and what you are, there are two things that are going to be very important for your future and your potential riches.\n\n\n1. Lou is a VERY rich old man. He sits at his computer in a huge house on Molokai and his bank account has MILLIONS in it that he is not sharing with anyone. He donates it to churches and homeless programs and all sorts of other crap and it looks like he will leave NOTHING to me when he dies, which should be soon. He has prostate cancer and will not last many more months. This is the last chance for both of us to empty his accounts and fill our own.\n\n\n2. Because of his age, he's easily confused. He fucked up over and over while dealing with you and asked me to help. He gave me access to his email and I've been monitoring your progress and now he doesn't know what to do. I'll be happy to pretend to help him while you and I suck as much money out of him as we can. It will be a LOT of money as he believes that I have contacted you and have everything worked out to get him the millions from you. Remember, Lou's email is now controlled by ME and he will only receive messages from you when I allow it.\n\n\nHere is my proposal, read it well and work with me and you will see more money than you ever imagined in your entire scamming life:\n\n\nForget about the stupid $640. Lou never managed to send it and the bank manager called me to try to figure out what the hell was going on. That's how I got involved and now we can work together.

Once we have gotten as much out of him as we possibly can...or the old fart dies...I will send you half of what we have stolen.\n\n\nIf we work together and do this correctly, I am certain that we can get several hundred thousand US dollars from this operation. Maybe more.\n\n\nSo there it is. You can work with me and biggest the richest man in your little town or you can get nothing, which would be fucking stupid. I control this situation and you have no real choice, of course. We can do this together as partners or you can just crawl into the desert and die.
