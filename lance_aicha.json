I think I am officially available, and believe that we should see each other in a more adult way when you get to the US.<br><br>\n\nArthur is gathering the Order to go fight Mordred and his gang. Mordred is actually Arthur's son... and nephew. I won't expose you to the details, but Arthur's (half) sister Morgana is not exactly the wholesome type, if you know what I mean.And of course Arthur's parentage is not exactly crystal pure, either.No wonder Mordred turned out this way.
