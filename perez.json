I had a lot of fun, feel free to publish it in\nyour web site.\n\nI\u0092ve reading your page for a while, and as far as I\nknow, this is the first time they include a Web site\nfor the consignment company:  \nhttp://www.crownsecuritiesbv.com\nNote from ScamO:\n\nWe aren't surprised the Lads from Lagos don't watch The Beverly Hillbillies :)   \n-- BUT they could have put more work into their web site:\n* CROWNSECURITIESBV.COM maps to 216.219.254.234\n(use unix/windows tools such as \"nslookup\" for this,  or free utilities, \nor commercial products such as AGNet Tools)\n* 216.219.254.234 maps to CyberGate, Inc. in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, USA.\nSpecifically it is assigned to ValueWeb, a commercial ISP.\n* So, the Lads have either created a shell company in the Netherlands, \nor simply invented a company name. Third, least likely possibility - \nthey are impersonating another, legimitate Dutch firm, and have hijacked \ntheir web site. Is it not scamalicious? Enjoy!\n\nNote from a Kindly Contributor in the Netherlands:\n\nA few things you should know:\n- the Dutch postfix 'BV' is like 'Ltd' in the US\n- There is no 'Crown Securities' company in Amsterdam (Try Google!)\n- The 'Kuudelstraat' is nowhere in Amsterdam. In fact, it's nowhere in the\nNetherlands! (try it yourself: http://www.locatienet.nl - \"Straat:\nKuudelstraat\" - tick \"Zoek naar straten\" - Start)\n- 06xxx or +31-6xxx is a cellphone (Amsterdam = 020 / +31-20). So\napparently, the fax is connected to a mobile phone aswell. Unfortunately I\ncouldn't trace this phone number, the website I for that use only handles\nstationary phones.\n- The zipcode (1015 CS) is the 'Keizersgracht' - a rather expensive street\nin Amsterdam.\nhttp://www.infobel.com/netherlands/wp/extsearch/default.asp - \"Where:\n1015cs\" - Search\n- The website is registered by 'Tara Wilson' in Louis, MO. Not at all\nDutch...\n\nSo your second assumption was right: The Lads have invented a company name\n(and done a bad job at that, now that the Net can be used for some minor\ndetective work)."], "messages": [{"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "", "author_role": "scam", "body": "FROM;HAJIA MARIAM ABACHA.  \nDear Friend,  Please I shall fully understand your\napprehension \ntowards this contact, be rest assured that you have a \nchoice to accept my proposal, or turn it down. \n\nFollowing the sudden death of my husband, Late General\nSanni Abacha, the former head of state of the federal \nrepublic of Nigeria in June 1998, I have been thrown \ninto a state of utter confusion, frustration and \nhopelessness by the present civilian administration. \nSecurity agents in Nigeria have subjected me to \nphysical and psychological tortures.
