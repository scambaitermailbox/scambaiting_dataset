The reason I decided to go to a different agent is because the\nfirst one I went to stuffed us around so much. First they don't put enough\nnumbers on the form, then the second time they get the number wrong. That\nseems a straight forward explanation to me.\n</p>\n\n \n\n<p>\nSo I went to another agent this morning in the next main town and told them\nthat I have a very important Red Carpet event to attend in Florida later\nthis month and could they please get the transaction right for me. The nice\nlady who served me (looked a bit like Meryl Streep in fact) has assured me\nthat the money and payment has been processed correctly now. We did a\ncompletely new transaction, as the first payment never went anywhere.\n</p>\n\n \n\n<p>\nPlease find attached the scan of the Western Union payment. I sincerely hope\nyou do not have any more embarrassment when you go to collect the\nregistration fee this time.
