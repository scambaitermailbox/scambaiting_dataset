I will be able to offer you the loan of\n$1000,000.00 I have stated the terms of the loan below for you to see and\ntell me if you are in agreement with the loan terms or not.\n\n\n*Loan Amount:$1 million USD\n*Loan Rate :5%\n*Duration: 40years\n*Loan Interest;$500USD\n*Number of Payments:480\n*Cumulative Payments:$2,314,539.50\n*MonthlyPayment:$4,821.97USD\n*Total Payment: $1,314,539.50USD\n\n\nCONDITION\nThere are two option which you are required to choose from which is the\ncollaterals and non collateral loans\n\n\n1. Collaterals Process: I usually require an equity based property as\ncollateral for my loan aquisition. You need to send me a collateral for\nthis loan so that i may have the trust that as soon as i give you this\nloan, you will pay back at the need of the terms. I do not accept any other\nproperty type or kind due to the fact that some of our \ncustomers have missed used this oppotunity. They some times claim to have\nproperties and send us copies of ownership, and when they are not able to\npay back the loan and i want to claim these properties i then \nfind out that the properties belong to their family.The family will then\nsay they did not attest to the transaction at first so please you have to\nmake sure that the collaterals you are dropping belongs to you and not your\nfamily.\n\n\nNon Collaterals Process: This process required deposited of payment. For\nthe loan of $10,000.00 you are entitled to send a payment of $350 so that\nif you are unable to pay back the loan,your collaral will be claim and you\nwill be placed on the media house by the bank as most wanted person which\nwill destroy your family names plus yours. If you pay back the loan,your\npayment will be returned back to you. One thing about this alternative\noption is that it is a Non-collateral/security obtained from banks here\nwhich is popularly known as bank securities. When you obtain this\nnon-collateral/security, it actually yield value which will eventually be\nequivalent to the loan you are obtaining during the stipulated duration of\nthe loan. When you are unable to pay back the issuing Bank take the\nnon-collateral which has yielded value as substitute for the loan.\n\n\nI will issue out your loan to the transfering bank immediately the\ncollateral is provided or the non collateral for the loan is acquired from\nthe bank. Because of the risk and expenses when collarals are presented, So\nthis is why i personally will always advice that our customers should\nsimply go for the non collateral alternative when they do not have an\nequity based property to present as colleral.But if you still insist that\nyou present an quity based property then that will be ok with us.\n\n\n2. Transfer Of Your Loan: Bank to Bank Transfer : The transfer of the loan\nmust be a bank to bank transfer,Western union/Money gram money transfer,or\ncourier services except otherwise stated by the borrower which means, you\nwill have to provide the means which you want your loan transfer to you.\n\n\n3. Loan agreement document:The Loan agreement document need to be signed to\ntrust some guarntee of you to me that i can trust you. Remember that is a\nlarge some of amount which is needed by you.\n\n\n4. Loan refund:The loan must refunded back to the lender at the end of the\ntenure the loan seeker is seeking the loan for without any delay.for this\nreason, for this reason,we are giving a maximum duration of five years to\nthe loan seeker so that he /she will be able to repay the loan within that\nperiod.\n\n\nAnd note that you will have to send me a copy of your identity card so that\ni may know who i am dealing with.\n\n\nConsidering the above conditions if they are acceptable to you,you have to\ngive me a fast response.\n\n\n\nHave a nice day\nMr.Thomas David\nGMD", "raw": " <div id=\"record\">\n\t<div id=\"char\"><span class=\"td\">Thomas David aka Tummy Divot</span>\n\t</div>\n\t<div id=\"dialog\" class=\"st\">\n\n\n\n\n<p>\nMay 11th  (via gmail)\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\nHello Mr.Ryan,\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI am in receipt of your email.

They some times claim to have\nproperties and send us copies of ownership, and when they are not able to\npay back the loan and i want to claim these properties i then \nfind out that the properties belong to their family.The family will then\nsay they did not attest to the transaction at first so please you have to\nmake sure that the collaterals you are dropping belongs to you and not your\nfamily.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\nNon Collaterals Process: This process required deposited of payment. For\nthe loan of $10,000.00 you are entitled to send a payment of $350 so that\nif you are unable to pay back the loan,your collaral will be claim and you\nwill be placed on the media house by the bank as most wanted person which\nwill destroy your family names plus yours. If you pay back the loan,your\npayment will be returned back to you. One thing about this alternative\noption is that it is a Non-collateral/security obtained from banks here\nwhich is popularly known as bank securities. When you obtain this\nnon-collateral/security, it actually yield value which will eventually be\nequivalent to the loan you are obtaining during the stipulated duration of\nthe loan. When you are unable to pay back the issuing Bank take the\nnon-collateral which has yielded value as substitute for the loan.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\nI will issue out your loan to the transfering bank immediately the\ncollateral is provided or the non collateral for the loan is acquired from\nthe bank. Because of the risk and expenses when collarals are presented, So\nthis is why i personally will always advice that our customers should\nsimply go for the non collateral alternative when they do not have an\nequity based property to present as colleral.But if you still insist that\nyou present an quity based property then that will be ok with us.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n2. Transfer Of Your Loan: Bank to Bank Transfer : The transfer of the loan\nmust be a bank to bank transfer,Western union/Money gram money transfer,or\ncourier services except otherwise stated by the borrower which means, you\nwill have to provide the means which you want your loan transfer to you.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n3. Loan agreement document:The Loan agreement document need to be signed to\ntrust some guarntee of you to me that i can trust you. Remember that is a\nlarge some of amount which is needed by you.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n4. Loan refund:The loan must refunded back to the lender at the end of the\ntenure the loan seeker is seeking the loan for without any delay.for this\nreason, for this reason,we are giving a maximum duration of five years to\nthe loan seeker so that he /she will be able to repay the loan within that\nperiod.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\nAnd note that you will have to send me a copy of your identity card so that\ni may know who i am dealing with.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\nConsidering the above conditions if they are acceptable to you,you have to\ngive me a fast response.\n</p>\n\n\nHave a nice day<br />\nMr.Thomas David<br />\nGMD\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n</div>\n \n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "", "author_role": "scam", "body": "May 12th  (via gmail)\n\n\nHello once again Mr. Nigel Ryan-Schama,\n\n\nI am very sorry for my mistakes like you pointed out.

How can yourun a\nsuccessful loans and finance company if you don't keep\nclients'correspondence on file?<br />\nMy response: Of course, all our entire letters is in my archives because it\nis mandatory each company have their certified file and record of which my\ncompany has such remembrance files and records.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\nYour word: As for offsetting the fee, OK I understand, you want me to pay\nit.

That's what I meant when I said I was still working on the\ncollateral.

On the other hand, if\nyou are willing to present collateral it will be also accepted by us!\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\nYour word: So you're with the Blessed Loan Company, that's great.

Collaterals Process: I usually require an equity based property as\ncollateral for my loan aquisition. You need to send me a collateral for\nthis loan so that i may have the trust that as soon as i give you this\nloan, you will pay back at the need of the terms. I do not accept any other\nproperty type or kind due to the fact that some of our customers have\nmissed used this oppotunity. They some times claim to have properties and\nsend us copies of ownership, and when they are not able to pay back the\nloan and i want to claim these properties i then find out that the\nproperties belong to their family.The family will then say they did not\nattest to the transaction at first so please you have to make sure that the\ncollaterals you are dropping belongs to you and not your family.\n\n\nNon Collaterals Process: This process required deposited of payment. For\nthe loan of $1,000.000 you are entitled to send a payment of $3,500 so that\nif you are unable to pay back the loan,your collaral will be claim and you\nwill be placed on the media house by the bank as most wanted person which\nwill destroy your family names plus yours. If you pay back the loan,your\npayment will be returned back to you. One thing about this alternative\noption is that it is a Non-collateral/security obtained from banks here\nwhich is popularly known as bank securities. When you obtain this\nnon-collateral/security, it actually yield value which will eventually be\nequivalent to the loan you are obtaining during the stipulated duration of\nthe loan. When you are unable to pay back the issuing Bank take the\nnon-collateral which has yielded value as substitute for the loan.\n\n\nI will issue out your loan to the transfering bank immediately the\ncollateral is provided or the non collateral for the loan is acquired from\nthe bank. Because of the risk and expenses when collarals are presented, So\nthis is why i personally will always advice that our customers should\nsimply go for the non collateral alternative when they do not have an\nequity based property to present as colleral.But if you still insist that\nyou present an quity based property then that will be ok with us.\n\n\n2. Transfer Of Your Loan:\n\n\nBank to Bank Transfer : The transfer of the loan must be a bank to bank\ntransfer,Western union/Money gram money transfer,or courier services except\notherwise stated by the borrower which means, you will have to provide the\nmeans which you want your loan transfer to you.\n\n\n3. Loan agreement document:The Loan agreement document need to be signed to\ntrust some guarantee of you to me that i can trust you. Remember that is a\nlarge some of amount which is needed by you.\n\n\n4. Loan refund:The loan must be refunded back to the lender at the end of\nthe tenure the loan seeker is seeking the loan for without any delay.for\nthis reason, for this reason,we are giving a maximum duration of five years\nto the loan seeker so that he /she will be able to repay the loan within\nthat period.\n\n\nAnd note that you will have to send me a copy of your identity card so that\ni may know who i am dealing with.\n\n\ni am a catholic by faith i do receive holy communion every week don't be\nworried your money will get to you all you need to do is to follow the\nprocedures.Mr. Ryan Schama please everything now is left tyo you so your\ndecisoin on time will save you and i.YES AS YOU ASKED IF MY COMPANY IS A\nCO-OPERATIVE GROUP.WE A CO-OPERATIVE GROUP.i will forward the terms and\nconditions to your lawyer\n\n\nThanks And God Bless\nMr.Thomas David\nGMD", "raw": " <div id=\"record\">\n\t<div id=\"char\"><span class=\"td\">Thomas David aka Tummy Divot</span>\n\t</div>\n\t<div id=\"dialog\" class=\"st\">\n\n\n\n<p>\nJune 9th, Tummy Divot to NRS\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\nHello Friend<br />\nThis the fo rthe collateral and non-collateral process please choose which\nway you want and don't hesitate to send the agreement documents fees please.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n1.
