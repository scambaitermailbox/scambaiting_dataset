I hope that he is more efficient than Barrister A B Williams may the Sacred Queen enrobe him in a shroud of wax!<br>\nI will get in touch with Viga Assistance Security Coy today and let's hope that we can speedily bring this matter to an end.  I am preparing for your arrival at the Church of the Blessed Beehive by having a special cocoon prepared in your honour.  For the Pupation Ceremony (at which time you will be absorbed into the Church) you will have of course have to wear a special gown to honour the Sacred Queen and the Drone Council.<br>\nCould you please let me have your measurements so that I can get our tailor Dan de Lion to get started.<br>\nI also need one last photograph from you for the Initiation Council.  This will be for Hive ID card, our guard drones can get very aggressive if you're not wearing your robes and Hive ID at all times.<br>\nPlease send me a photo of you holding a sign measuring not less than 20cms x 15cms with the words 'BUZZ BUZZ BEEHIVE' written clearly in black ink.  Once we have that I can send you back your HIVE ID which can also be used in lieu of a Visa when entering the state of Texas.<br>\nDon't delay.  The sooner we get all these little points sorted out the sooner we can get the money and you to Texas.<br><br>\nGo with God.
