It began operations on August 1, 1973 and granted the first loan on January 16, 1974. The Fund provides finance on concessional terms for the purpose of assisting the Bank's contribution to the economic and social development of its African members, and to the promotion of cooperation, including regional and sub regional cooperation, and increased international trade, particularly among such members. The African Development Bank (ADB) (also known as Banque Africaine de Developpement) is a major development bank in Africa. It was established in 1963 by the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) with start-up capital of $250 million in order to promote economic and social development. Since then it has grown into a $33 billion, multinational development bank, with 52 African and 24 other shareholders. ADB is backed by both African members and other overseas principals to provide Africa with greater independence from offshore credit. The ADB finances project and program investments in member states, with a focus on regional projects.\n\nIn this I want you to understand what the ADF stands for I want you to note  that we are a NGO that is not profit oriented but we stand for the development of Africa in general in the last five years we have had nothing less than 5,000 complaints exactly like yours directly to our office also from the IMF and the world bank group people that complain that their funds are tied up within African countries and officials are constantly requesting extra ordinary fees from them and when they pay there is nothing but more fees it is as if it is never going to end with this constant complaints from foreign investors it has led to a decrease in foreign investment in Africa as it is getting to be the general belief of foreigners that investing in Africa is a bad investment to get their funds out again is almost impossible this has slowed development in most African countries greatly. We as the African development fund a Non-profit Organization set up for the development of Africa was mandated to look into the situation and find a solution and this program is what we came up with the main aim of the program is to get foreign investors to receive part or all of their funds as soon as possible so we devised the program to assist this African countries by requesting that all overdue payment that has been pending should be transferred to we will make part payment on all this payments this funds we will be using to fund this program will serve as a loan to each countries to be paid back over the years this whole program is purely to stimulate development in Africa.\n\nWhat I am trying to bring out here is quite simple we are an independent body in a bid to save a situation and make it a win win situation for foreign investors and African government the ADF has agreed to fund this debts and pay all investors immediately a part payment in order to restore the trust in investing in Africa I can categorically tell you that as of now we have registered at least 90% Success as the response by foreign contractors has been great and Drafts have been sent out and funds have been received we are happy that there is progress. Be rest assured once more that once we receive from you the required fee to insure your draft and the courier charge within 24Hrs your draft will be sent out to you to which ever address you specified understand also the need for insurance and cost of courier as the draft is a very sensitive financial instrument we cannot afford to have it travel uninsured but what we did was to try and subsidise the cost of insurance so no matter the amount it does not exceed 5,000 USD which we believe that any foreign investor will be able to pay without any hitch. Based on this high rate of Success also considering the fact that we are close to the end of the first stage I don\u00d5t think the board will be willing to change it's mode of operation because of one request, We have far more beneficiary than the funds we have left it will just be a few days before everything is concluded if you indeed wish to participate in this program I suggest you don\u00d5t even waste one more day.\n\nIn conclusion note that we have signed the agreement with Nigeria, South Africa among other African countries and we have been given the mandate whatever the problem associated with your funds to release immediately a part payment to you so please be rest assured that we will indeed do our job I give you my word again that within 24hrs of our receiving the insurance/courier charges from you your draft will be on it's way.
