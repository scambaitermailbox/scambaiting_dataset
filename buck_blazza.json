This bank officer has gotten in the middle of it, and is being very rigid about the whole thing.<br><br>\n\nAlso, I will rely on you to make sure this is done properly and clearly.  The bank officer appears to be a rather sloppy individual who can't even get the amount straight.  As Mr. Blazza is very ill and apparently not capable of watching this transaction in detail, if you could act as intermediary to assure that all paperwork and other items are in line and that no mistakes are made, I would appreciate it very much.<br><br>\n\nBy the way, where are you located?  If you are in the same country as the bank, it might help things along.<br><br>\n\nBest regards,<br>\nBuck Turgidson<br>\n<font color=\"blue\"><b>\n<i>Buck discovers that the lawyer is HE WHO MUST BE PAID.</i>\n</b></font>\n<br><br>\n\n \n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "KennethLawChambers LomeTogo >kennethlaw_chambers@yahoo.fr<", "to_name": "Buck Turgidson", "date": "2005-03-03 07:39", "subject": "KENNETH LAW CHAMBERS AND WE HAVE FOUND OUT THE CORRECT AMOUNT..", "author_role": "scam", "body": "KENNETH LAW CHAMBERS SOLCITOR AT THE HIGH COURT OF LOME TOGO  116 RUE DELCAMP, LOME TOGO, TELEFAX : 00228 9259063    EMAIL:kennethlaw_chambers@yahoo.fr\n\nREF N : 839/MCA45LR/05\n\n                                                                                                          Date : 03/02/05\n\nATTENTION: BUCK TURGIDSON\n\nRE: WE ACCEPT LEGAL REPRESENTATION.\n\nWE RECEIVED YOUR LETTER OF 02ND,2005 REQUESTING US FOR LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOR THE PURPOSE OF REPRESENTING YOU AND PROCURING THE NECESSARY ITEMS/DOCUMENTS (OPENNING AN OFF-SHORE ACCOUNT AND OTHER ITEMS THAT THE BANK MAY REQUIRED FROM YOU) AS REQUIRED BY THE BANK TO EFFECT THE TRANSFER OF YOUR INHERITANCE FUND ($TWO MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS)FROM THE BTCI BANK DORMANT ACCOUNT, THAT WAS WHAT WE FOUND OUT AFTER OUR DISCUSSION WITH THE BANK.\n\nYES!

Based on some evidence I have from some printed email\nmessages, your address in his address book, and his last will and\ntestament, I believe you knew him and were in the process of transacting\nsome business with him.\n\nIt is my very unfortunate duty to inform you that we received word a few\nhours ago that Mr. Turgidson is missing and presumed dead in a plane\ncrash over Cote d'Ivoir, West Africa.  He was flying from Freetown\nSierra Leone, to some location in Ghana (we believe Accra, though his\nplans had changed in route).  His plane exploded about 419 miles out\nfrom Freetown.  Reports from the area indicate that there was a huge\nfireball, an explosion which was both terrible and beautiful to behold,\nfollowed by a rain of debris from the aircraft which inexplicably\nincluded a large number of watches and handsets.\n\nI am reviewing items in his office, getting his affairs in order to\nassist his girlfriend and prepare for the worst when we are told\nofficially of his death.  He apparently thought highly of you.  I say\nthis for a number of reasons.  These reasons include the fact that he\nhad spoken to me of you briefly, that he had your address and phone\nnumber in his address books, and had been conducting some correspondence with you.  His girlfriend also remembers his mentioning you to her.\n\nWhile I truly regret delivering this bad news, I need to let you know\nhow Mr. Turgidson felt about you.  Apparently he felt strongly enough\nthat he actually had me alter his will before he left on his trip to\nAfrica.  While he was not a rich man, he was in the process of selling\nhis tour company, and this sale is expected to complete in the next week or so.  It should bring in a little more than $2.5 million, including sale of his remaining aircraft.  While you are not his sole heir, he did leave a significant bequest to you, which will probably amount to about $560,000 after the sale of the tour company is completed.\n\nI can not guarantee the results of the sale of the tour company, and the\nwill has not been officially read at this time, but I wanted to let you\nknow of this bequest in case you wished to pursue the matter further.\nAs you are out of the country, my duty will be limited to informing you\nof your inclusion in his will, after which it will be up to you to\npursue the matter further if you wish.  United States inheritance law\ndoes not require that we expend significant effort to deliver a bequest\nto a foreign citizen. Nevertheless, I feel a duty to let you know your\nrights.\n\nOnce again, let me share my sincere condolences on the departure of your friend and business partner.  Please let me know if there is anything I can do for you.

He was flying from Freetown\nSierra Leone, to some location in Ghana (we believe Accra, though his\nplans had changed in route).  His plane exploded about 419 miles out\nfrom Freetown.  Reports from the area indicate that there was a huge\nfireball, an explosion which was both terrible and beautiful to behold,\nfollowed by a rain of debris from the aircraft which inexplicably\nincluded a large number of watches and handsets.<br><br>\n\nI am reviewing items in his office, getting his affairs in order to\nassist his girlfriend and prepare for the worst when we are told\nofficially of his death.  He apparently thought highly of you.  I say\nthis for a number of reasons.  These reasons include the fact that he\nhad spoken to me of you briefly, that he had your address and phone\nnumber in his address books, and had been conducting some correspondence with you.  His girlfriend also remembers his mentioning you to her.<br><br>\n\nWhile I truly regret delivering this bad news, I need to let you know\nhow Mr. Turgidson felt about you.  Apparently he felt strongly enough\nthat he actually had me alter his will before he left on his trip to\nAfrica.  While he was not a rich man, he was in the process of selling\nhis tour company, and this sale is expected to complete in the next week or so.  It should bring in a little more than $2.5 million, including sale of his remaining aircraft.  While you are not his sole heir, he did leave a significant bequest to you, which will probably amount to about $560,000 after the sale of the tour company is completed.<br><br>\n\nI can not guarantee the results of the sale of the tour company, and the\nwill has not been officially read at this time, but I wanted to let you\nknow of this bequest in case you wished to pursue the matter further.\nAs you are out of the country, my duty will be limited to informing you\nof your inclusion in his will, after which it will be up to you to\npursue the matter further if you wish.  United States inheritance law\ndoes not require that we expend significant effort to deliver a bequest\nto a foreign citizen. Nevertheless, I feel a duty to let you know your\nrights.<br><br>\n\nOnce again, let me share my sincere condolences on the departure of your friend and business partner.  Please let me know if there is anything I can do for you.  If you wish, I can let you know of the progress of the investigation of his death and upcoming schedules for the probate of his will.<br><br>\n\nBest wishes,<br><br>\n\nCharles Addams<br><br>\n\n \n<font color=\"blue\"><b>\n<i>John is interested and wants the lawyer's advice.</i></b></font><br><br>\n\n \n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "", "author_role": "scam", "body": "Date       Thu, 7 Apr 2005 11:47 AM \n \n\nAttn:Charles Addams,\n\nThank you for the information that you gave to me,it is unquite unfortunate that it happen in this way.As it is now i don't know what to do and what to say but as a lawyer what do you sugget that i do?\n\nWaiting to hear from you.\n\nBlazza", "raw": " <hr><font face=\"Georgia,Arial,Verdana\"><b><i><font color=\"red\">John Blazza</font></i></b><br><br>\n\nDate       Thu, 7 Apr 2005 11:47 AM <br><br>\n \n\nAttn:Charles Addams,<br><br>\n\nThank you for the information that you gave to me,it is unquite unfortunate that it happen in this way.As it is now i don't know what to do and what to say but as a lawyer what do you sugget that i do?<br><br>\n\nWaiting to hear from you.<br><br>\n\nBlazza<br><br>\n\n \n<font face=\"Arial,Verdana\">\n<font color=\"blue\"><b>\n<i>What do YOU think the Lawyer should do with Jonh?</i></b></font><br><br>\n \n \n \n\n", "comments": []}]}
