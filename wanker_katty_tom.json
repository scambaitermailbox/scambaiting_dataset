Just when I figured all was lost, sure enough I get another message telling me I'd better hurry to another Western Union office to get my BMW on the next shipment. \"Game On!\", as Francis Begbie would say. Hence the transcript attached, and Arnold's fishing trip to Dead Yankee Creek, cunningly designed to coincide with a business trip that I was on, to explain the sparse communication from my end.\n\nSadly, in  one of the later messages, you'll notice that my next Western Union rep mistakenly signed his name \"Hugh\" instead of \"Phil\" (hey, what can I say... I was on my way to the morning presentation and stopped in a hurry to send out the message. They were most surprised ten minutes later in the talk when I clapped my hands to my head and screamed \"Dammit!\"). Hopefully they're stupid enough not to notice, and I've tried to minimize the damage by transitioning from Phil McCavitty to P. Hugh McCavitty. My guiding principle is never to underestimate my opponent, so I've assumed the worst and tried to tempt them back with a fake WU receipt that I'm actually somewhat proud of."], "messages": [{"from_name": "<ealmekinder@nc.rr.com>", "to_name": "enquiry_claimsoffice@yahoo.co.uk", "date": "2007-07-07 04:30", "subject": "BMW:2551256003/23--CONGRATULATIONS!!!

First, let me say that \nI was very, very depressed when the incident in the picture happened. Let me assure you that I've \nnever done anything like that before or since. Please tell me you've deleted the picture that was sent. \nI could lose my job over this. I will send you the scanned copy of the transfer receipt, but for my own\nself-preservation I will wait until I'm assured you've destroyed all copies of the picture.<br /><br />\n\nThanks<br />\n\nPhil McCavitty\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "Customer Services", "to_name": "Phil McCavitty", "date": "Sat 7/21/2007 4.35 AM", "subject": "Information", "author_role": "scam", "body": "Dear Mr Phil McCavitty,\nI received your email and have destroyed all the past attachments and pictures we received from and on behalf of the customer.\n \nWe are still expecting the payment slip from your end.\n \nMrs Katty Tom.", "raw": "\t<div id=\"record\">\n\t<div id=\"char\"><span class=\"kt\">Mrs Katty Tom</span></div>\n<div id=\"dialog\">\nFrom: Customer Services [shippingservices@globalexpresss.com]<br />\nTo: Phil McCavitty <br />\nSubject: Information <br />\nDate: Sat 7/21/2007 4.35 AM<br /><br />\n\nDear Mr Phil McCavitty,<br />\nI received your email and have destroyed all the past attachments and pictures we received from and on behalf of the customer.<br /><br />\n \nWe are still expecting the payment slip from your end.<br /><br />\n \nMrs Katty Tom. \n</div>\n</div>\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "Customer Services", "date": "Mon 7/23/2007 6.48 AM", "subject": "", "author_role": "bait", "body": "Dear Katty,\n \nThank you for your understanding.
