I have beenhired by Fred and Wilma Flintstone to handle a transaction between the two of you, specifically, the transfer of $3000 to you. Although I would not recommend for them to proceed with this transaction without some type of security deposit from you, Fred INSISTS that I get this certified check sent to you immediatley without delay, and since I am bound to follow my clients wishes, that is what I must do.\nHowever, there is just one problem. Fred said he has told you numerous times that there is no <span class=\"wu\">Western Union</span> anywhere near Bedrock, so sending this by <span class=\"wu\">Western Union</span> will result in at least a 4-5 day delay. My advice to you is to send me your mailing address, and I can use an overnight service we have called FexEd. They ship anywhere in the world guaranteed overnight, however they need and address to deliver to, and someone must be there to sign for delivery. Please email me your mailing address today without delay and this will be a simple transaction.
