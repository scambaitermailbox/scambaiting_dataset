I contact you ind\nependently and no one is informed of this communication.I would like to int\nimate you with certain facts that I believe would be of interest to you. \n In 1999, the subject matter came to our bank to engage in business discu\nssions with our private banking division. He informed us that he had a fina\nncial portfolio of 4.35 million British Pounds Sterling, which he wished to\n have us turn over (invest) on his behalf.I was the officer assigned to his\n case, I made numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de-facto c\nhief operations officer of the private banking sector, especially given the\n volume of funds he wished to put into our bank.  We met on numerous occa\nsions prior to any investments being placed. I encouraged him to consider v\narious growth funds with prime ratings.  The favored route in my advise t\no customers is to start by assessing data on 6000 traditional stocks and bo\nnd managers and 2000 managers of alternative investments.\n Based on my advic\ne, We spun the money around various opportunities and made attractive margi\nns for our first months of operation, the accrued profit and interest stood\n at this point at over 6 million British Pounds Sterling, this margin was n\not the full potential of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteed return\ns on investments. In mid 2002, he asked that the money be liquidated becaus\ne he needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments.He directe\nd that I liquidate the funds and have it deposited with a security firm. \n I informed him that Barclays would have to make special arrangements to \nhave this done and in order not to circumvent due process, the bank would h\nave to make a 9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statu\ntory charges. He complained about the charges but later came around when I \nexplained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us. Large ca\nsh movements have become especially strict since the incidents of 9/11. I c\nontacted my affiliate and had the funds available as he had requested.  I\n undertook all the processes and made sure I followed his precise instructi\nons to the letter and had the funds deposited with a security consultancy f\nirm. This security firm is an especially private firm that accepts deposits\n from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle val\nuable products or undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash\n..  This small and highly private organization is familiar especially to t\nhe highly placed and well-connected organizations. In Line with instruction\ns, the money was deposited with them.He told me he wanted the money there i\nn anticipation of his arrival from Norway later that week.\n This was the las\nt communication we had, this transpired around 25 th February 2003.  In J\nune last year, we got a call from the security company informing us of the \ninactivity of that particular portfolio. This was an astounding position as\n far as I was concerned, given the fact that I managed the private banking \nsector I was the only one who knew about the deposit at the security compan\ny, and I could not understand why our client had not come forward to claim \nhis deposit.I made futile efforts to locate him.  I immediately passed th\ne task of locating him to the internal investigations department of Barclay\n.. Four days later, information started to trickle in, apparently our man wa\ns dead. A person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart at\ntack in Canne, South of France. We were soon enough able to confirm all of \nthis including cause of death. The bank immediately launched an investigati\non into possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and als\no to come forward to claim his estate.  If you are familiar with private \nbanking affairs, those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity,\n but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes. In his bio\n-data form, he listed no next of kin.\n In the field of private banking,openi\nng an account with us means no one will know of its existence,accounts are \nrarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the acco\nunts anonymous.  This bank even gives the choice to depositors of having \ntheir mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring that there are\n no traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they nominate next of ki\nn. Private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usual\nly in most cases leave wills in our care, in this case; our now deceased cl\nient died in testate. \nIn line with our internal processes for account holde\nrs who have passed away, we instituted our own investigations in good faith\n to determine who should have right to claim the estate. This investigation\n has for the past months been unfruitful. We have scanned every continent a\nnd used our private investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of\n the problem.  It is this investigation that resulted in my being furnish\ned with your details as a possible relative of the deceased.My official cap\nacity dictates that I am the only party to supervise the investigation and \nthe only party to receive the results of the investigation.  It is quite \nclear now that our dear fellow died with no known or identifiable family me\nmbers. This leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the \nprevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the late beneficiary\n of the deposit.\n\n  According to practice,the security company will by the e\nnd of this year broadcast a request for statements of claim to Barclays, fa\niling to receive viable claims they will most probably revert the deposit t\no Barclays. This will result in the money entering the Barclays accounting \nsystem and the portfolio will be out of my hands and out of the private ban\nking division.This will not happen if I have my way. \n  What I wish to r\nelate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want you to understand \nsomething. It is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the intern\nal politics of the banking world aberrational. The world of private banking\n especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who sit upon certain cha\nirs and oversee certain portfolios.\n You should have begun by now to put tog\nether the general direction of what I propose. There is 4,350,000.00 dep\nosited in a security company.I alone have the deposit details and they will\n release the deposit to no one unless I instruct them to do so.  I alone \nknow of the existence of this deposit for as far as Barclays is concerned, \nthe transaction with the late customer concluded when I sent the funds to t\nhe security company all outstanding interactions in relation to the file ar\ne just customer services and due process.The security company has no single\n idea of what's the history or nature of the deposit. They are simply await\ning instructions to release the deposit to any party that I may direct.This\n is the situation.  This bank has spent great amounts of money trying to \ntrack this man's family; they have investigated for months and have found n\no family. The nvestigation has come to an end.\n My proposal; I am prepared t\no instruct the security company to release the deposit to you as the closes\nt surviving relation. Upon receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share t\nhe money with you in half. That is: I will simply nominate you as the next \nof kin and have them release the deposit to you.We share the proceeds 50/50\n.. You with the same very name as the original depositor would easily pass a\ns the beneficiary with right to claim.  I assure you that I could have th\ne deposit released to you within a few days.I will simply inform the bank o\nf the final closing of the file relating to our late client.I will then off\nicially communicate with the security company and instruct them to release \nthe deposit to you.With these two things: all is done.  The alternative w\nould be for us to have the security company direct the funds to another ban\nk with you as account holder.This way there will be no need for you to thin\nk of receiving the money directly from the security company as it is not a \nconventional financial institution; they accept deposits from only organiza\ntions thus; what you hand over to them is what you get back. They do not ha\nve the means to process the money.  We can fine-tune this based on our in\nteractions.\n\nI am aware of the consequences of this proposal.I ask that if yo\nu find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail.I ask \nthat you do not be vindictive and destructive.If my offer is of no appeal t\no you, delete this message and forget I ever contacted you. Do not destroy \nmy career because you do not approve of my proposal. You may not know this \nbut people like myself who have made a tidy sum out of comparable situation\ns run the whole private banking sector.  I am not a criminal and what I d\no, I do not find against good conscience, this may be hard for you to under\nstand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this move. Such\n opportunities only come ones way once in a lifetime.I cannot let this chan\nce pass me by.For once I find myself in total control of my destiny.This ch\nance wont pass me by.  I ask that you do not destroy my chance, if you wi\nll not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not \ndestroy me.I am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide them wit\nh new opportunities.There is a reward for this project and it is a task wel\nl worth undertaking.I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have her\ne is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank.  I am the on\nly one who knows of this situation, good fortune has blessed you with a nam\ne that has planted you into the center of relevance in my life. Lets share \nthe blessing.\n\nIf you find yourself able to work with me,contact me through t\nhis email. If you give me positive signals,I will give you the relevant det\nails and initiate this process towards a conclusion. I wish to inform you\n that should you contact me via official channels;I will deny knowing you a\nnd about this project.I repeat,I do not want you contacting me through my o\nfficial phone lines nor do I want you contacting me through my official ema\nil account. Contact me only through this email account I do not want any di\nrect link between you and me. My official lines are not secure lines as the\ny are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line w\nith our total Quality Management Policy.Please observe this instruction rel\nigiously.  \n\nPlease, again, note I am a family man,I have wife and children\n..I send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what the conseque\nnces, but I know within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained and that\n success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold.This is the one\n truth I have learned from my private banking clients.
