I am inclined to my friend Ilichy's view\n  that you are a joker and not worth wasting any further time on. My\n  adventure with the egg nog has still left me weak, and without bothering\n  to seek out your mediocre apartment again, whether it is near the meat\n  market or not, I am taking the first flight home. I am already overdue\n  for my academic work and cannot spare more time on this nonsense. One\n  bright note is that yesterday I was able to rise early and see the\n  Temple, which is all I desired before leaving.\n   \n  If you still wish to pursue this ill conceived enterprise then I suggest\n  Hippo Bank contacts Ilichy as soon as possible. I will tell Professor\n  Vas Deferens to relax, as soon as this comes.\n   \n  Arch\n  \n</pre>\n\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "\"Yosep Pramudito\" joshepjoe@yahoo.com", "to_name": "", "date": "2003-04-06 12:45", "subject": "", "author_role": "bait", "body": "Dear Ilichy,\n  Have long period I  have not contacted you.\n And yesterday, when I surfing in the\n internet to completed my work  paper in my\n studying, I was very shock when you have\n publicated all our correspondence.
