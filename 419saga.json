The amount that you quoted of $4,200 is quite a bit just to\nput into an account. Our general amount here was only $20.\nPerhaps you can detail to me why the amount is so great as you are the\naccounts director.\nYou also mentioned that time is a factor here, but I do not wish to\njust rush into something such as this. I have done this in the past\nand have vowed never to do so again.

As you are an\nonline bank, I was hoping I could do most of this online using\nservices such as PayPal, that way another bank account would not be\nnecessary.\nHowever, I do understand the need to deposit money to a bank account\nas I worked at the Great Canadian Trust bank for a period of about 4\nyears. The amount that you quoted of $4,200 is quite a bit just to\nput into an account. Our general amount here was only $20.\nPerhaps you can detail to me why the amount is so great as you are the\naccounts director.\nYou also mentioned that time is a factor here, but I do not wish to\njust rush into something such as this. I have done this in the past\nand have vowed never to do so again. Please send me your web address\nso I can get the necessary info that I require.\nI'll be contacting friends and family to try and collect $4,200. But\nI do still wish to know why it is so much.\nThanks\nL. Senna\n\n",
