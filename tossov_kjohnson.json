Not since the Custard Loans affair of a few years back has my office life been so full of passion and excitement at what each day brings. Your emails are a wellspring of romance for this old commercial dog, who feels as bouncy as a puppy at heart these days, and I am grateful for your continued interest in me. \n\n\nThank you for your concern over my health. To be honest I do feel a little the worse for wear today. Yesterday I left the office in high spirits and managed a good 13 holes at Smegaroon National before the monsoon rains started down. I was soaked of course, but still managed a good par before abandoning matters for the club house and the traditional sing song round the fire. My caddy Miracsky was less fortunate but once he had been retrieved from the quagmire that was bunker no 4 he too became reasonably cheerful.\n\n\nI must say that the problems you are having with your boss seem terrible. Is there no way he can be contacted? The bounder ought to be horsewhipped for leaving such a sweetheart as yourself alone, and at the mercy of things too. I am not sure what I can do by way of assistance being so far away. If he is a member of the local fiduciary council then perhaps some pressure could be applied, but I doubt it. I hope he has not left his employee in too much of a lurch, it would be terrible to think of you at the mercy of debts and worry. I am greatly worried I must admit.\n\n\nAs I write this I could not help but have my blotter open so that I can gazing lovingly once again upon your face, and even caught myself sighing like a schoolboy. So much so that my financial secretary thought I had discovered a discrepancy in the accounts.  It really cheers me up and makes this grey day a little bit more bearable. If you have that bikini one ready some time soon I would really love to see it.

Not since the Custard Loans affair of a few years back has my office life been so full of passion and excitement at what each day brings. Your emails are a wellspring of romance for this old commercial dog, who feels as bouncy as a puppy at heart these days, and I am grateful for your continued interest in me. \n</p>\n \n<p>\nThank you for your concern over my health. To be honest I do feel a little the worse for wear today. Yesterday I left the office in high spirits and managed a good 13 holes at Smegaroon National before the monsoon rains started down. I was soaked of course, but still managed a good par before abandoning matters for the club house and the traditional sing song round the fire. My caddy Miracsky was less fortunate but once he had been retrieved from the quagmire that was bunker no 4 he too became reasonably cheerful.\n</p>\n \n<p>\nI must say that the problems you are having with your boss seem terrible. Is there no way he can be contacted? The bounder ought to be horsewhipped for leaving such a sweetheart as yourself alone, and at the mercy of things too. I am not sure what I can do by way of assistance being so far away. If he is a member of the local fiduciary council then perhaps some pressure could be applied, but I doubt it. I hope he has not left his employee in too much of a lurch, it would be terrible to think of you at the mercy of debts and worry. I am greatly worried I must admit.\n</p>\n \n<p>\nAs I write this I could not help but have my blotter open so that I can gazing lovingly once again upon your face, and even caught myself sighing like a schoolboy. So much so that my financial secretary thought I had discovered a discrepancy in the accounts.  It really cheers me up and makes this grey day a little bit more bearable. If you have that bikini one ready some time soon I would really love to see it.

Even during today, amidst the dryest presentation, my mind wondered and I thought of you, with all your troubles. Although reasonably well off now, I know full well what it is like being without the adequacies to sustain oneself. I remember when I first arrived here, some 30-odd years ago, it was with barely 50 dorks in my pocket and just one big idea - to corner the custard commodity market. From this small seed, and through constant determination and grit, grew the foundation of a business which today flourishes and has over 200 employees, and which had added to the well being of many.\n\n\nNow my dear, the $750 you mention. I am not sure Western Union is the best way to send it, as previously I mentioned. Anyone might intercept the funds, leaving you as badly off as you are present. Cannot another way be found? Or, if it came to it perhaps one of my more trusted representatives can locate you and press some dollars into your hand personally? Just an idea, you understand.\n\n\nI hope you are bearing up well today.

Even during today, amidst the dryest presentation, my mind wondered and I thought of you, with all your troubles. Although reasonably well off now, I know full well what it is like being without the adequacies to sustain oneself. I remember when I first arrived here, some 30-odd years ago, it was with barely 50 dorks in my pocket and just one big idea - to corner the custard commodity market. From this small seed, and through constant determination and grit, grew the foundation of a business which today flourishes and has over 200 employees, and which had added to the well being of many.\n</p>\n \n<p>\nNow my dear, the $750 you mention. I am not sure <span class=\"wu\">Western Union</span> is the best way to send it, as previously I mentioned. Anyone might intercept the funds, leaving you as badly off as you are present. Cannot another way be found? Or, if it came to it perhaps one of my more trusted representatives can locate you and press some dollars into your hand personally? Just an idea, you understand.\n</p>\n \n<p>\nI hope you are bearing up well today.
