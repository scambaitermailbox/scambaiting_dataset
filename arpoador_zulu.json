This is very weird.

But I digress.\n\n\u00c2\u00a0\n\n- what was arranged with Mr Zulu Duru was the transfer of U$ 2,143.56 from the International\n\nChristian Alliance of Africa to an account in your bank, provided you guarantee that the money can be delivered personally to him, so he can travel to Luanda and then fly to Lisbon, where he is to receive a temporary political refugee Visa.\n\n\u00c2\u00a0\n\nPlease understand that I am forced by the Alliance internal policy to conduct all our contacts via e-mail, so this is the reason I am not calling you. Also understand that you can wait till Mr Duru is safe in Portugal before you proceed with the transfer of his funds. We would prefer to open an account for him in our bank (BCP-Millenium, Chiado Branch) but his refugee condition would be revoked if the government discovered that he possesses so much money. So we will have to proceed afterwards with the transfer to our account.\n\n\u00c2\u00a0\n\nIn order to allow us to transfer the U$ 2,143.56, please provide us with all the details concerning the account of Mr. Howard Sow. We will also need a scanned image of his ID Card or passport, where his photo and ID number can be clearly viewed. This is due to the accounting practices adopted in the European Union following the attacks of September 11, 2001. I also asked the same documents from Mr. Zulu, and I printed his e-mail authorizing Mr. Sow to receive his airplane tickets money. Due to the sad and extreme conditions of his present situation, this will serve, in our files, as proof of his will to receive the money via Dr. Sow.\n\n\u00c2\u00a0\n\nI also want to clarify that U$ 1,000 should be used to travel from Dakar to Luanda, and the rest (U$ 1,143.56) will pay for a TAP (Portuguese Airlines) airplane ticket to Lisbon. Please remind Mr. Duru that he has to present his ID card to TAP in order to purchase the ticket, and to inform the attendant he is travelling on a special arrangement involving the International Christian Alliance of Africa refugee program. This will circunvent the need of a passport, as his name has been sent to the TAP headquarters by Mr. Manuel Alegre.\n\n\u00c2\u00a0\n\nHE MUSTN'T FORGET to tell us of his date, time and flight of arrival in Lisbon, so we can be waiting for him at the airport and help him during is interview with the immigration officers.

A much better forgery than the ones he\nsent me... I also manufactured a personal invitation from Portugal's President,\nso he could skip Immigration.<br><br>\n\nI wondered what would happen when he arrived at TAP's Dakar offices with this\nprintout, looking for Ms. Maria Bucetagrande (BigCunt) or Mr. Joaquim\nPaupequeno (SmallPenis) to get his boarding pass. I thought he'd go there -\nbecause I hinted he could get a refund on the ticket I (allegedly) purchased.\nBut he apparently made some enquiries...<br><br>\n\nI also hope your readers have as much fun as I had. I think I could go on and on\ninsulting Zulu Duru, while he waited for the 500 euros, but I'd rather prepare\nfor the next Mugu.<br><br>\n\nKeep up the good work.<br><br>\n\nP.S. - S0U#8URR0, Zulu's TAP reservation code,  means \"I'm an Idiot\" in\nPortuguese. A pun lost.<br>\nP.S. 2 - Weirdly, a Google search on \"Zulu Duru\" reveals his scam.
