However strange\nor surprising this contact might seem to you as we have not met\npersonally or had any dealings in the past, I humbly ask that you take\ndue consideration of its importance and the immense benefit it will be\nto you.\n\nAfter careful consideration with my children, we resolved to contact you\nfor your most needed assistance in this manner. I duly apologize for\ninfringing on your privacy, if this contact is not acceptable to you, as\nI make this proposal to you as a person of integrity. \n\nFirst and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you.

When I was sworn in as Deputy Minister of\nMinerals and Energy in 1996, with my influence, my husband Mr.Ndelebe\nShabangu a very successful businessman was awarded several contracts in\nmy ministry and had direct dealings with foreign investors in this\nfield. Due to my political status, I was not involved in my husband's\nbusiness which was very vast and successful. \n\nMy beloved husband died whilst on an official trip to Trinidad and\nTobago in February 2001. When my husband died, I was contacted as next\nof kin by a private security firm in Europe to come forth with the\nCertificate of Deposit and claim a safety deposit my husband has in\ntheir Vault in his name. At that time, my children and I did not have an\nidea where the Certificate might be. We then instructed the security\nfirm to continue holding the safety deposit until further instructions\nfrom me. Whilst preparing for the second remembrance of my beloved\nhusband, I was going through his library collection and to my\nastonishment I discovered a ,Certificate of Deposit for the safety\ndeposit with this private security firm, and other documents relating to\nthe safety deposit in a book. \n\nThe safety deposit which is a trunk, is stocked with hard currency (US\nDollars)totalling $18,500,000 which was generated from cash payments\nfrom his business associates in the diamond trade. Though I knew my late\nhusband was in the diamond business, I did not have the knowledge that\nhe moved funds in cash. This has came as a shock to me and my children,\nand we have decided to have this fund invested immediately in commercial\nand residential properties abroad as well as profitable ventures, as any\nmember of my family cannot hold such a huge amount in our name due to my\npolitical status, hence we sincerely propose to you to render us your\nmost needed assistance in this regard.If you agree to render us your\nassistance, your role in this project will be to act on my behalf as a\ntrustee to receive the safety deposit containing the funds from the\nSecurity firm. Though I believe this transaction should be based on\nmutuality, my family's interest will be protected by a family associate,\nwho is a diplomat. He is now aware of the safety deposit, and I have\ninformed him that I am locating one of my husband's business associates\n(you) to handle the funds and invest on our behalf, as he might be\nopposed to our decision if he found out that I barely know you. The part\nof services the diplomat is required to render is to assist you in\nclaiming the consignments from the terminal of the security company and\nto set up a transit domiciliary account in your name in one of the prime\nbank he has contacts to carry out the exercise through the back door. \n\nThe purpose of the account is to enable you deposit the funds for\nfurther transfer into your nominated bank For your reliable assistance,\nwe are offering you 15 %($2,775,000) of the funds. I thank you in\nadvance as we anticipate your assistance in enabling us achieve this\ngoal. On hearing from you, I will forward your contact to the diplomat\nwho will be representing us, and also give you his contact for both of\nyou to communicate and proceed with the transaction. He will be working\nwith you for a mutual conclusion of the process and I look forward to a\nlong lasting business relationship with you.

I have been very prompt in responding to your letters but\nunfortunately you have not provided me with the same courtesy. When you\nfailed to reply to my email you left me no choice but to cancel my\nflight plans and to void my mobile phone application. Except for this\nproject I had no other use for it.\n\nLike I said in my previous email, because of your lackadaisical approach\nto these modalities, it's obvious to me that you have more important\nthings to do there in South Africa than to move your $18.5 million out\nof the country. With your lack of dedication and sincerity to this\ntransaction, I don't know that I see a need to carry it any further. I\nalso have to say that if this is how you perform your duties as Deputy\nMinister of Minerals and Energy, I forsee major, uh, rock shortages (or\nwhatever kind of minerals it is you deal with) in South Africa's near\nfuture.\n\nWhile I was looking forward to claiming my share of the fund so that I\nmight relocate to my native Georgia, it is not absolutely necessary to\nmy existence. I have enough money to live here quite comfortably. With\nthis in mind, should you decide you want to continue this relationship,\nI suggest you get your thumb out and get this thing moving. When you\nhave PROMPTLY answered the questions that I posed in my previous\ncorrespondence, I may consider re-entering the transaction. Otherwise, I\nsee no need for future contact.\n\nHui Tyebye,\nUncle Joe", "raw": "<hr><b><font color=\"blue\">JOSEPH STALIN</font></b><br><br>\n\n\n\n\nSent: Thursday, March 17, 2005<br><br>\n\nTvarish Susan,<br><br>\n\nAfter reading your letter I had to take a moment (and a small quantity\nof Igor's Stolichnaya) to calm myself down. My initial  reaction was to\nscramble the Backfires and write to you and your lazy, dimwitted brother\nsuggesting that each of you invest in a good pair of sunglasses, as both\nJohannesburg and London were about to get dramatic demonstrations of\nnuclear fusion.
