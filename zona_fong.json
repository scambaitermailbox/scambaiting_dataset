I have an obscured business suggestion for you. Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client Salman Jaber Salman who was with the Iraqi Military forces, and also a business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 3 years, with a value of Eighteen Million Euros only in my branch. Upon maturity several notices were sent to him, during the Iraq war. Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. It came to our notice that the man (Salman Jaber Salman) and his entire family had been murdered during the war in a bomb blast. You can read more about the bombings on visiting this site below:\n \n \nhttp://civilians.info/iraq/deaths_frameset.html\n \n\n  Right now in my bank under an alias which only the two of us knew about as the confidentiality of the matter was necessary for his protection. Due to his untimely death, the funds have been sitting in the account ever since and will continue to do so perpetually unless we do something about it.\n\nThis is where you come in. I located you through an agency that helps seek people by their email. My client did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit of Eighteen Million Euros.. Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I would like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to our client so that you will be able to receive his funds. I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we can come out successfully. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary documents that will back you up as the next of kin to my client. All that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job.\n\n After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also file in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that you will provide. There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going to adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Once approved, the entire transaction should take no longer than twelve business days after which we will go about our daily businesses, but just millions of Euros richer.\n\n   As you can see this is easier than taking a candy from a baby, but mind you, trust is something that is developed over time and that is something that we do not have. The transfer can only be authorized into your account by my department of which I happen to be the head. The money will be transferred from my bank to an account which I will advice you to provide. So I have to let you know that it will be highly unfeasible to try to cheat on me with the money because you only, will be able to make transfer of the money in and out of the account. So please, there should be no room for greed. The allocation of our money will be as follows: 30% to you for your part in this, 60% for me and 10% for any unforeseeable expenses we may incure. I think this is extremely fair, as you have nothing to lose but just a little time. I will assume all responsibilities for this endeavor. Your urgent response is anticipated. This should be kept very secret and confidential. I believe you know.\n\n \n\nKind Regards,\n\nMr. Patrick Fong.\nHang Seng Bank Ltd\nFu Shan Mansion 25\nTaikoo Shing Road ,\nTaikoo Shing Branch \nHong Kong.",

You should not have anything to worry about. I will do everything legally required to ensure that the project goes smoothly, it shall pass through all Laws of International Banking. \n \nHaving agreed to entrust this project into your hands, I want to remind you that, it needs your commitment and diligent follow up. If you work seriously, the entire matter should be over in a couple of days. Please understand that this deal would be done strictly via e-mail as I don't want any trace discussing about this on phone for lingual purpose. \n \nREAD THE FOLLOWING AND GET BACK TO ME: \n  \nFirstly, I will want to know your occupation, you should note that this project is highly capital intensive. This is why I have to be very careful. I need your total devotion and trust to see this through. I know we have not met before, but I am very confident that we will be able to establish the necessary trust that we need to execute this project. \n \nI am now in contact with a foreign online bank. I now intend that you open an account in your name in this foreign bank. The money would be transferred to your account which you will open in the bank for both of us, this is the best way, I have found to get this money out of my bank, and the main reason for this is that, if we use this online bank, the transfer would be seen as an In-house bank to bank transfer as the online bank has the same telex type as my bank (Hang Seng Bank) and it also solves the problem of transferring. I want us to enjoy this money in peace when we conclude. So you should listen to my instructions and follow them diligently. \n \nAlso you have to know that I cannot transfer this money in my name as my bank will be aware that it is from me. This is where I need you. As result of this, you will have to open an account in the corresponding bank. I will obtain a certificate of deposit from this my bank; it will be issued in your name. This will make you the owner of the funds, after this, the money will be banked online for both of us as I will personally make the transfer from my bank to your account which you will open with the online bank. \n \nWe can then instruct the bank to transfer our various shares into our respective home bank accounts. I will also perfect the documentations with the assistance of my attorney to give the project the legal rights so please do not worry about this. I would appreciate you send me a copy of your National Identity (Driver's license or An International Passport). As soon as I get these from you I shall commerce with the paper work and would as well send you a copy of my Work ID. The money in question is big and I want to ensure that I know you well before I proceed to give you all the details to commence the project. \n \nI will send the name and contact details of the correspondence online bank to you so that you can have an open communication with them. Ensure that you keep this project confidential; do not discuss it with anybody, because of the confidential nature of this project and my work. Please confirm to me you got this mail so I could advice how we proceed \n \nPlease reply soonest.\nRegards, \nMr. PATRICK FONG",

I believe you don't understand much about this transaction and I'm always ready to explain to you better.  \n\n    Mr. Salman jaber who is an Iraqi, used to live and work in Hong Kong . We both met and secretly discussed about depositing the money in my branch, which no one else knew about. I'm seeking your help here to act as his Next of Kin, so we could both get this money out of my Bank and I have every necessary document backing this claim.  Being a Bank Manager, it doesn't make sense transferring the total sum into my bank account, because there are Monetary Bodies monitoring every transactions made from my bank. This is why I have asked you to set-up a new account.  I'm asking you to set-up an Intermediary account with a Well know bank to me in the UK , then I can transfer the total sum into the account, so you can make further telegraphic transfer from it.  I would appreciate you read my previous messages carefully and understand me better.  The bank which I would refer you to is a Bank that shares the same Telex Type with my bank and the transfer from my bank will be seen as an In-house transfer, then we wouldn't have any problem with the Monetary Bodies.  \n\n    Ben, you have to read my messages carefully so you could understand me better.   Now there are 2 options transferring the money out of my bank, which is the most important step. ( 1) It's either you open an online account which I can transfer the total money into then you can make further transfer into our various accounts OR (2)  I will try my best within my connections to move the total Money to a finance company in the UK, then you go down there to sign up the release. Please try to read carefully and understand me.\n\n   About trust, this is what we have to build as we are getting to know each other better and as time goes on we could both find trust in ourselves. There is a large room for trust between us, as you and know this transaction involves a huge sum and there should be no room for greed. I'm waiting to hear from you.\n\nThank you,\n\nMr. Patrick Fong",

Are you intrested in this Transaction at all,or you are just trying to make a fool of me?  I seriously don't understand what you mean by DEAD PEOPLE MIGHT AWAKE. The fact that Salman Jaber is dead doesn't mean the money will be left in the account forever. If the Monetary Bodies of my Bank should find out about these funds, then the money is gone. Please understand the reason why i am so much in a hurry to getting this Money out of my bank.\n \n   Nationwide Finance is a private finance company which deals with only selected clients. Its not a Public Bank.\n \n   Now the bank should have gotten back to you, please update me about the bank. If you haven't gotten a response please do contact them again.\n \nThank you,\nMr. Patrick Fong",
