Milico is a rude way to address military people in\nArgentina, not offensive now, just rude (military men use it to call\nthemselves when talking casual)\nThe photo of myself is a photo of Guillermo Francella, a very popular\ncomedian from Argentina (not a good one in my humble opinion). The photo is\n(I think) from one of his movies, so I don't attach here for copyright sake.\nHe is a dark hair good looking man with a big moustache and a friendly grin.\nI think Simbi will fall in love with him.\nAnd, as you may imagine, I'll try to open a B-story to this saga, with the\nteen romance of Edwin and my \"daughter\" Sarah (shhh, don't tell Simbi, but I\nwill be Sarah too... well, she will be Edwin, so we will be lying each other\nsquared, haw haw haw). I hid Sarah's email account for secrecy sake, but it\nmeans \"Sarah the rude\".\n\nLater that day I wrote to the security company", "Hi Scamoramers\nthis is the third chapter of the second season of Argentina 3 Lads 0.

I wish him well.\nIn accord of his papers, everything is going fine, there's only a missing\ninformation, Edwin's blood type.\nMy friend says that is very important for him to have a NABO account or he\nwon't be able to join any of the Ankh-Morpork's Guilds.\nI started looking for a school for him. Since I don't know his knowledge\nlevel I can't really figure it out where he must be, but I think he can\neasily join the Flem Snopes Memorial School or the Panglossian Institute of\nTechnology, if he can pass the exams, though.\n\nYou had a weird dream about our god, madam, since yesterday I felt a cloudy\npresence near the altar. I thought it was just a product of my stressed\nmind, but now I believe it was your kathru (third soul) who was wandering\naround the holy shrine.\nYou ask me for information about Horeakar. Well, it is hard to compress a\nreligion in a brief description but let's say that the Sleddic faith is a\npyramidal one.\nOn top of it there's one God untangible, unnamed and unknown. This God is\ndivided in three Gummorii (Sons): Ravishankar, Horeakar y Shamhakar.\nRavishankar is, to put it simple, the Universe, which makes him impossible\nto represent since is \"all\" and everything that exists is literally a part\nor Him.\nHoreakar is the Creative God. Everything is created by Him. His three legs\nare not limbs in the literal meaning of the word but the three Principles of\nCreation. There is no picture of him (we can't worship images), so I can't\nsend you one. We used to represent Him with a triskelion, but in the second\nhalf of the XX century we stopped since it was always mistaken with a\nswastika and we with nazis (nothing is oposite to the Sleddic faith as\nNazionalsocialism, but people is stupid and linear minded)\nShamhakar is the Uncreative God. Everything is uncreated (destroyed) by Him.\nHe is NOT an evil God, He is the Inverse Flow of Energy, the Opposite (but\nnot the Foe) of Horeakar, He is the Second Part of the Cosmic Cycle. He is\nan Ever Staring Eye and we represent Him as a circle with a dot in its\ncenter.\nUnder the Three Gummorii are the Nine Pankhu, gods that rule the opposites\nof the World. For example, Mukharett is the god of Love/Hate, Borlugg is the\ngod of Peace/War, Hu Ho is the god of Male/Female, Kerpell is the god of\nLight/Darkness, and so on.\nThe Pankhu are over the 27 Morlovii, who are in charge of many aspects of\nLife (like Yrretizher, who is the god of sperm, and Oriter, who is the god\nof eating), and the Morlovii are over the 81 Nap'Ilut, which can be\nconsidered as small gods. Finally, under the Nap'Ilut are the 243 Odradek,\nwhich can be seen as angels, seraphims and cherubs in the christian faith.\nOf course there is more about the faith. When we meet in Abidjain I promise\nto give you a copy of our Holy Book, the Zlh\u0091ber Khadir.\nAlso I'll give you some pamphlets and flyers about the many steps you must\ngive if you want to thread along the Sleddic path.\n\nI don't know if the Seccurity Company told you but I have the chance to make\na quick visit to Cote d'Ivoire in July 9, from 2 PM till 5 PM. I apologize\nfor not staying longer but I will be using a little free time I have from a\nGuild Meeting in Tunizia. I choose to do so because it was impossible for me\nto go to Cote d'Ivoire before August 3, which I think it would be too late\nfor you. I apologize but I'm to busy.\n\nSo, I'll be at the door of the Seccurity Company at 2PM of July 9.

I wish him well.<br>\nIn accord of his papers, everything is going fine, there's only a missing\ninformation, Edwin's blood type.<br>\nMy friend says that is very important for him to have a NABO account or he\nwon't be able to join any of the Ankh-Morpork's Guilds.<br>\nI started looking for a school for him. Since I don't know his knowledge\nlevel I can't really figure it out where he must be, but I think he can\neasily join the Flem Snopes Memorial School or the Panglossian Institute of\nTechnology, if he can pass the exams, though.<br><br>\n\nYou had a weird dream about our god, madam, since yesterday I felt a cloudy\npresence near the altar. I thought it was just a product of my stressed\nmind, but now I believe it was your kathru (third soul) who was wandering\naround the holy shrine.<br>\nYou ask me for information about Horeakar. Well, it is hard to compress a\nreligion in a brief description but let's say that the Sleddic faith is a\npyramidal one.<br>\nOn top of it there's one God untangible, unnamed and unknown. This God is\ndivided in three Gummorii (Sons): Ravishankar, Horeakar y Shamhakar.\nRavishankar is, to put it simple, the Universe, which makes him impossible\nto represent since is \"all\" and everything that exists is literally a part\nor Him.<br>\nHoreakar is the Creative God. Everything is created by Him. His three legs\nare not limbs in the literal meaning of the word but the three Principles of\nCreation. There is no picture of him (we can't worship images), so I can't\nsend you one. We used to represent Him with a triskelion, but in the second\nhalf of the XX century we stopped since it was always mistaken with a\nswastika and we with nazis (nothing is oposite to the Sleddic faith as\nNazionalsocialism, but people is stupid and linear minded)<br>\nShamhakar is the Uncreative God. Everything is uncreated (destroyed) by Him.<br>\nHe is NOT an evil God, He is the Inverse Flow of Energy, the Opposite (but\nnot the Foe) of Horeakar, He is the Second Part of the Cosmic Cycle. He is\nan Ever Staring Eye and we represent Him as a circle with a dot in its\ncenter.<br>\nUnder the Three Gummorii are the Nine Pankhu, gods that rule the opposites\nof the World. For example, Mukharett is the god of Love/Hate, Borlugg is the\ngod of Peace/War, Hu Ho is the god of Male/Female, Kerpell is the god of\nLight/Darkness, and so on.<br>\nThe Pankhu are over the 27 Morlovii, who are in charge of many aspects of\nLife (like Yrretizher, who is the god of sperm, and Oriter, who is the god\nof eating), and the Morlovii are over the 81 Nap'Ilut, which can be\nconsidered as small gods. Finally, under the Nap'Ilut are the 243 Odradek,\nwhich can be seen as angels, seraphims and cherubs in the christian faith.<br>\nOf course there is more about the faith. When we meet in Abidjain I promise\nto give you a copy of our Holy Book, the Zlh\u0091ber Khadir.<br>\nAlso I'll give you some pamphlets and flyers about the many steps you must\ngive if you want to thread along the Sleddic path.<br><br>\n\nI don't know if the Seccurity Company told you but I have the chance to make\na quick visit to Cote d'Ivoire in July 9, from 2 PM till 5 PM. I apologize\nfor not staying longer but I will be using a little free time I have from a\nGuild Meeting in Tunizia. I choose to do so because it was impossible for me\nto go to Cote d'Ivoire before August 3, which I think it would be too late\nfor you. I apologize but I'm to busy.<br><br>\n\nSo, I'll be at the door of the Seccurity Company at 2PM of July 9.
