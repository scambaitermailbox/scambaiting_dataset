Maybe, but that won't be of much help for the first 20 years or so after they're born. You may be a top-notch nuclear physicist but I'm afraid your expertise as a demographer falls somewhat short.\n\n \n\nThe nearest money unin transfer office is in Irkutsk, 8 hours away by car. I will arrange for Ms. Bushburn, my admin assistant, to make the trip first thing in the morning, weather permitting. Once she has sent the money she will call me with the details and I will forward them to you.\n\n\nIn the meantime, I would like to be appointed as your 'Survivor Selection Czar' in charge of setting policy in the chosing of who goes to the island. We need to make sure my, uh, I mean our, immediate needs are met. I also want to be able to screen all names to be sure one of my ex-wives doesn't make the list.\n\n\nI would like to submit the following suggestions for your approval:\n\n\n1. No husbands - This will only complicate things as you know how possessive husbands can get. We tell them that the wives have to go to the island first and that we'll send the plane back for them (the husbands) in a day or two. Whether we do or not will be determined at a later time, maybe in a year or so after the black hole gets 'em.\n\n\n2. Reduce the initial number of men to no more than 5 and I'll only chose guys who are real goblins. Less competition for you and I.\n\n\n3. What about booze? Have you made any arrangements for stockpiling? I don't want to have to drink fermented mango juice the rest of my life.\n\n\nProfessor Miller, we have a chance to build a utopia on that island, a brave new world. It is imperrative that we get things started off on the right foot. This can be a real paradise if we set it up correctly from the start.\n\n\nLet me know what you think and I'll get Ms. Bushburn off to Irkutsk tomorrow.\n\n \nLewd", "raw": " <div id=\"record\">\n\t<div id=\"char\"><span class=\"ln\">Lewd Noogie</span>\n\t</div>\n\t<div id=\"dialog\" class=\"ast\"> \n\t\n\nProfessor Miller,\n\n<br /><br />\nIf I understand your email correctly, you anticipate eventually having 10,000 women on the island as time goes on.
