I have enclosed a photograph, taken\na recent interview I had with Cat's Weekly. May I have yours? I like to see\nwhom I'm dealing with.<br> <br> \n \nI am also concerned about being a registered company in your country. Bluntly\nput, we have never sold any products in Nigeria. I'm barely aware where Nigeria\nis! Is there any way around this? You are an important bank official. Could you\nnot bend the rules, or bribe someone?<br> <br> \n \nI'd rather not give you my phone number either. You mention my family; I live\nwith the bitch from hell. Everyday there's floods of tears and door slamming,\nstamping feet across the landing. As a matter of fact, I'm going to use some of\nthe cash to fund a divorce. But while I live with Janet I cannot risk her\nfinding out anything about this affair. It would mess up everything. I can't\neven send you emails from my home, for fear she might see what I'm typing. I\nhave no idea how our son, Jason, managed to be so well balanced. He studied\nmedicine at Harvard University, and now works in New York. I'm always glad to\nsee him and his friends, particularly a young man called Neil. But Janet is\nanother matter altogether. Do you have a family? Does your wife ever give you\ntrouble?\n <br> <br> \nI'm sorry I cannot provide any more help. But I am confident you will find a\nsolution, since this clearly means so much to you.<br> <br> \n \nRegards,\n <br> \nChristopher Tennant<br> <br> \n\n\n<i>Who needs Photoshop?
