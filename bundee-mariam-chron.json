,<br />\nA salaam Alaikum, I thank Allah for making both of you to write me back so quickly, aunty in the first place I am an orphan, if uncle has not told you, but I have decided to come out from this camp now that I am 21years, I do not intend to marry your husband, but I am looking a family who will adopt me as there own daughter and receive my inheritance, because I am too small to handle the money, I fear when I hear about the amount and o know that I cant handle such money alone, looking for a boy firend will be the worst part of it, he might receive my inheritance and  betray me or send me out of his house at the end of the day, that was why I need a family who will take me as there daughter and help me register me in a university, and also train me because I am lacking parental care, I lost my mum early when I was still a kid and now both of them are late.<br />\nAunty I will prefer to call you mum, if you don 't mind starting from today and if you don 't mind, send me your picture with uncles own so that I can know you people very well when I will be coming, to enable me recognize you and uncle when you will be coming to pick me up, mum please send me your phone number but the only little problem there is that they don 't allow us to use private phone here , but we have a pay phone boot where we can make calls to our guidance and also international calls, and not all the time, but I will try my best to call you instead I borrow money from my friends because international calls are very expensive here, mum I am very happy that you are now going to be my step mother and also my mother as well, and may Allah protect you and uncle for me  and I will be praying for both of you, insha Allah.<br />\nHugs to you mum and uncle <br />\nAllah with you over the

talks all this why and I don't know how to answer him sometimes, and I understand him as a young man who is very anxious of his parents, but you should make him to understand that I am of the family now, so that he don't ask too much question, and Gilligan told me that he spend a lot of money I the WASPS police before they release you from there custody, mum I am very sorry for what happened to you ad I missed you a lot, mum the money for the clearance fee for the camp is not $7000 but it is almost $7000, and the camp clearance certificate is what I will use to present before the immigration will offer me the new passport and also the visa to London, with the help of the traveling agent to London, and dad was the one who told me to make the arrangement on my own to start coming, and he will support me financially as he promised, mum but the most important thing now is to pay for the camp clearance, so that I can come out from this camp.\nMum the lawyer I told you is my late fathers lawyer and has been helping to pay so many fees here in this camp, my feeding and other little problems are been paid by him and he don't have to charge him for anything because he is representing my fathers as a good fellow, he was the one who took me to this camp for safety as I have earlier told you, mum he is not demanding any money from me or you, but what he is interested is for me to run

Ted and I are still having talks about our marriage   between the both of us, it involves many things that are just between him and me.  You are not married and will never understand.  \n\n\n    Ted is STILL mad about the fact that you constantly refuse to send to us any more pictures of yourself besides the only one that you have sent. He says that he is REALLY MAD that we have sent you $700 in cash which you have gotten and that all you have sent is the same photo and nothing new, the id card the same.   \n\n\n    Ted says that we should forget all about you and never help you any more. He says that you are just trying to scam us out of our money which we want to send and have sent. I do not know what a scam is and he tried to explain that it is when people pretend to be someone that they are not, just to get dollars/cash. I did not know this. You are not one of those scammers, I pray and hope. It would break my heart if I was to learn that you were not being honest and only after my money when all I have done is trusted you with all my heart and soul. Please say it is not true mariam! \n\n\n    I explained to Ted that you do not seem like one of these scam-persons, and that you seem like an honest and sincere young woman in desperate need of help in a refugee camp in Sudan that I want to help with all my heart. It hurts me to hear that the bombs are all over the place as you type. That sounds so horrible to hear. Ted said this to me---\"Okay if this missy Mariam is REALLY fair-dinkum and on the square, let her prove her honesty and sincerity and we shall find a way to solve her problems\".  \n\n\n    I know that my husband Ted is quite abrupt at times, but you must forgive him. Also realize that I did not forward any words he wanted to say to you in his anger. He was far more angrier at you but I am a lady and do not wish to use such words as he did in regard to you, so I will not say them.\n\n\n    Ted grew up in a home where both his mum & dad were abusive to him.

Both of Teds' parents perished in a ghastly crash but their life insurance left him almost $14million AUD. Soon after I met Ted and we hit it off right away, like two hooligans in a shag contest. And then he started up this here koala ranch and we now have 3 lovely children as well.\n\n\n    He and I have reached a decision--we DO want more pictures of you and there are 2 ways we can do this. We can send you $500 for to buy a new camera to send us photos of yourself, OR we can send you a used digital camera that our son Gilligan used 3 years ago on his class trip to Newton-john, Bolivia, South America. The boy does not need it any more, it is 3 years old--and useless technology. But  it can still snap photos and so can be of use to you. Anything to make Ted happy,  because HE is the one YOU are making angry on all this and he demands that we  see more of this mariam woman who wants money from us---his words, not mine.

One and a half table spoon of butter (or 2 table spoons of oil). \nSalt, and black pepper. \nThe Molokhya,  either green or dry. \nSteps\nAdd the Molokhya (one bag) to the 2/5 of soup and heat for about 15 minutes on not a very hot level. \nIt is not recommended to steer too much, so the Molokhya doesn't drawn in the bottom. (in case of green Molokhya, not dry) \nWhile cooking the Molokhya prepare the ta'leya ( no equivalent English term) \n\n\nThis is how to prepare the ta'leya:\nIn a soup pan, heat the butter, or the oil.

He was told that things will be worked out when the weather lets up..You surely do not have snow there in Sudan and so do not comprehend it all. We do indeed have snow here at times but not like they have in Europe at the present time. And most certainly your friend Mr Patrick Valerie there in London can tell you of all the snow there now. It is doubtful that he could even venture outside his house, with all that snow..\n It must have been quite a shock for him to go from the warm climate of Houston Texas USA to the cold snow now in London.. Where is he from?\n</p>\n \n<p>\n You must agree that GOD controls the weather and we humans have no say in the\n matters. What HE does, we can not change when the snows fall and close airports.  \n</p>\n \n<p>\n The koala buyers will fly to Darwin when things are better and another meeting can  be set up. And we will be happy to let you know the exact details on that as soon as we know them too. It is a good thing that Ted did not waste an 800km drive up there.\n</p>\n \n   hugs from mum Sheila\n\n   </div>\n   </div>\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "2010-12-03 07:40", "subject": "", "author_role": "scam", "body": "Hi mum\nGood evening mum and dad, I understand your message very well about the present climatic weather in Europe, mum I am using my last strength to write you this message, when I got your message I was shocked for some hours and I lost hope because I don't know when the meeting will be set up as you said.
