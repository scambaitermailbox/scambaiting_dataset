FOR, THE COMMISSIONER OF OATHS", "Harry Shipman, M.D.\n\n\n\n\nDear Mr. Ejor, Esq.\n\n\nAllow me to introduce myself. My name is Harry Shipman, M.D. , the\npersonal physician of Barnabas Roberts. Regrettably I must inform you\nthat Mr. Roberts passed away suddenly late yesterday afternoon, just\nbefore sunset. My patient was a very sick man and we can all be relieved\nthat his suffering has finally ceased. As you may know, a rare blood\ndisease rendered Mr. Roberts highly susceptible to bright light, a\ncondition which proved to be his downfall. Apparently an unthinking\nvisitor opened the curtains in his room yesterday afternoon. The\nprolonged exposure to the sun's setting rays proved fatal. :-( \n\n\nI spent the better part of this day taking care of bureaucratic\nformalities and just finished arrangements to have his belongings\nshipped back to his estate. I discovered in his appointment calendar his\nnotice to meet with you in Amsterdam. Having noted the e-mail address I\nfelt it best to inform you of the situation so you will not wait in\nvain. I do not know what business he had with you, or perhaps you are a\nfriend or former business associate he wished to greet. Before taking\nill Mr. Roberts was quite involved in his family's shipbuilding\nbusiness, through which he has made many contacts all over the world.\n\n\nI might add a few words in closing. Although Barnabas Roberts was\nstruggling with a terrible illness, it seemed to me in the last weeks\nthat he had found a new lease on life, a sudden burst of energy, as if\nsome positive project had given him hope. Perhaps in some way you had a\nrole in this. If that is the case, all of us who knew Barnabas owe you a\ndebt of gratitude.\n\n\nIf I may be of service to you, please do not hesitate to contact me. But\nfor now I am exhausted and must get some sleep, will fly back to Maine\ntomorrow.\n\n\nIn sad memory,\nHarry Shipman, M.D.", "Waldorf Flywheel\n\n\n\n\nDear Mr. Ejor,\n\n\nMy name is Waldorf T. Flywheel of Flywheel, Shyster and Flywheel,\nattorneys at law. I am the family attorney to the late Mr. Barnabas\nRoberts, former shipbuilding magnate, hereafter referred to as my\nclient. My client passed away recently during travels in Europe and it\nhas now fallen under my obligation, serving as executor to the estate,\nto locate all the beneficiaries to my client's vast holdings. \n\n\nWell, it has been a frustrating task. My late client's entire fortune:\nhis vault of over $666,000,000 US Dollars in cash guarded by live\nwolves, a lovely old mansion near Collinsport, Maine, and a metal strong\nbox containing erotic Dutch language publications, has been bequeathed\nto the \"Pitt Roberts Memorial Fund\". This is all well and good, but I\nhave had no success in locating such an entity. We have searched all\nofficial records, Roberts family archives, and google, but to no avail.\n\n\nIn desperation we attempted a search of known relatives: there was a\ncousin named Pitt Roberts who dropped out of sight several decades ago.\nThis, however, turned out to be a cold lead. My office performed a\ncomprehensive study of all obituaries in every major newspaper of the\nworld since 1970 and discovered that Pitt Roberts and all of his family\npassed away in a car accident several years ago. We suspect that the\nso-called memorial fund may have something to do with Pitt Roberts.\n\n\nHaving failed to locate either the \"Pitt Roberts Memorial Fund\" or a\nnext-of-kin I fear the entire assets will revert to the state government\nof Maine, which intends to waste it by tearing down all public buildings\nand putting up exact duplicates in their place. An upcoming appointment\nin probate court will decide this. Time is therefore running out.\n\n\nI am contacting you because my client apparently intended to meet with\nyou in Amsterdam at the time of his death. Maybe you are a relative we\ndo not know about. Possibly you are able to shed some light on this\nmystery and assist me in paying out this fortune to the \"Pitt Roberts\nMemorial Fund\"or a representative thereof, though I myself am skeptical\nthat such a fund even exists. If it does, my client succeeded in keeping\nit an absolute secret. \n\n\nPlease respond quickly as the matter is highly urgent.\n\n\nBest wishes,\n\n\nWaldorf T. Flywheel\n\n\nP.S.

It is not good when people are oppressed and\nhave no reason to shoot off fireworks at least once a year.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nYou have assuaged my concerns about the matter of my family relationship\nto Pitt and the sharing of the inheritance. I have no more doubts. It is\nhighly probable that Pitt was my cousin. I also do not mind the share\nyou have allotted. In fact I am impressed by your honesty. You could\nhave arranged to disappear with the entire amount. And this evening I\nwatched a movie about Mexico which absolutely gave me a positive omen of\nour business. Guess who starred in the movie: Brad Pitt and Julia\nRoberts! Do you see how the name \"Pitt Roberts\" comes to me in an\nastonishing manner to tell me you are legitimate. This tells me that\nwhat we are doing is right. What do you think of it?\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut now with your share of 40% the Pitt Roberts Memorial Fund which I\nwanted you to found with my share of the money will not be as full as I\nhad hoped. My wishes were to have at least $10 million USD as a basis.\nSo here is what I would like you to do: You open an account in your\ncountry and act as the administrator of my share of the money, which\nbecomes the Pitt Roberts Memorial Fund. I will make up the difference of\nthe money to bring it to $10 million USD in that memorial fund to make\nSagbama Express Road safe and aid the dependents of families wiped out\nby fatal and tragic accidents at this venue. Maybe we can also open up\nthe Pitt Roberts driving school. I am serious about this and hope you\nwill assist by enabling me to transfer money to this cause. Are you in a\nposition to help me with the formalities? As I am bedridden during the\nday hours I am in a poor position to arrange all necessary details.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSo I will make contact with the Finance company and take care of the\nformality of the claim form.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOnwards,\n</p>\n\nBarnabas\n\n</div>\n</div>\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "citytrust-fin@financier.com", "date": "2002-10-02 00:00", "subject": "Pitt Roberts' account", "author_role": "bait", "body": "To whom it may concern,\n\n\nI am in contact with Barrister Daniel Ejor concerning account number\n01433550018 left behind by Pitt Roberts.

I pray\nthat the God almighty guides and protects you.\n\n\nHowever, I am very sorry for not have written to you earlier before now,\nsince my previous mail to you, I have been very fixed with works. I have\nbeen going from one court to the other on behalf of my clients. Please\nbear with me.\n\n\nFurthermore, I got your mail dated 11th October 2002 in which you\nelaborated on where and how you want the ROBERTS\"S MEMORIAL FOUNDATION\nto be set up. Very good notion of yours by advising that it is going to\nbe set up in the Europe. It is very good, and inaugurating the\nfoundation in the Europe will attract more applause and achieving its\naim to the utmost level. All we have to do first now is to conclude our\nclaiming quest from the finance company immediately.\n\n\nMy dear, the problem now is that I will be unable to come to ICELAND\nlike you requested. It is not going to compromise with the service that\nI am currently rendering to my clients now. Also, it is going to do more\nharm than good to your inheritance claims from the finance company. Do\nyou know why? It is going to take me like two (2) months or more to\nobtain a visa to ICELAND. Note that the finance company will suspect\npranks from your side that you could not bring the simple evidences\nrequired from you in order to prove your inheritance claims.\n\n\nLet us act wisely, I advise that we conclude transaction first by\nsecuring the required documents from the appropriate office and send it\nto the finance company (GRUBBERS LIKE YOU CALLED THEM) to prove your\nclaim and get your cousin's (MR PITT ROBERTS) fund released to you, and\nbefore then, I must have been through with the works at my clients I\nhave at hand. Therefore, I will be very free to travel out of my\ncountry.\n\n\nThen, I would endeavour very hard to secure a visa for coming to ICELAND\nto meet you, knowing fully well that we have successfully achieved our\nclaims from the finance company that has been looking for a way to\nconfiscate this fund for their own selfish interest.\n\n\nAfter meeting you in ICELAND, I will then proceed to any country we deem\nalright for the setting up of the memorial foundation in Europe to\nsecure some necessary papers, which will give us the legal right to set\nthis foundation in Europe. This is the best idea for us to execute this\nwork successfully. I am like your legal attorney now, I pledge to make\nsure that our purported aim in this work is achieved, and also to give\nyou good advise on it. So I advise that we execute this work as I have\nexplained above and we will have no hindrance.\n\n\nMoreso, I got the forwarded attachment, which you got from the federal\nhigh court. Like I told you, the high court is very sensitive and\ndiplomatic in the sense that if we prolong further talk less of months,\nwhich it will take me to come to ICELAND and come back, the high court\nwill attend to us with suspicions and arms length in this inheritance\nclaim, which I am trying to avoid. Then if we have problem with the\nfinance company on the cause our late submission of the required proof\nfrom you in your inheritance claim and the case is taken to the federal\nhigh court, our attitude to the court too will be used as evidence\nagainst us. So let us answer them now and conclude this transaction\nwithout problem.\n\n\nI have studied the forwarded documents from the court.
