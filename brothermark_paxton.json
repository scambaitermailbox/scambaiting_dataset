I also did inform you that I have mapped out all possible ways to see this transaction through to success at the long -run, hence the need I have to explain properly to you why this plan was designed this way.\n \nIt would have been very possible getting the funds across to any designated account of your choice but its so unfortunate that this method can't be used in executing a project of the sort and magnitude because the monetary body would or might investigate about the fund in question when a large sum of this amount has been transferred into your account in your country. Basically because of this reason I have decided we use the same bank in Europe that has a transaction agreement terms with our bank in Europe and also both banks share same telex type.\n \nThis method stands as the fastest, safest and easiest means the funds can leave that escrow account after all documents in your name and favour has been filed for application of funds release.\n \nPlease note that you\u00d5re standing as the beneficiary of my funds which is another added advantage we have in getting the fund easily to your newly established account with the bank.\n \nKindly get back to me with your response after you have carefully read through the contents of this mail, so I can proceed in perfecting the documents in your name and favour and also furnish you with the contact Information of the bank so you can make enquiries on how to set-up an offshore transit account with their finance establishment.\n \nAll copies of documentations will be sent over to you for your perusal and file records as well.
