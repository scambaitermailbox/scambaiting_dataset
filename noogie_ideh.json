We dicussed this in some detail before I committed to the arms deal and you led me to believe you were on-board with it. Now you're backing out?? You let me put in $100,000 of my own money for you and now you say you're unhappy?? Musa, this is bogus! What are you trying to pull, my brother?\n<br><br>\nOk, lets do this - I've heard from the bank and they are requesting a $5,500 transfer fee to move the $35 million to my account. I told them that someone would be coming in to the bank to personally handle this and I've asked them for the branch name and street address. I'll forward this to you as soon as I receive it. I know you want to keep a low profile in this, so give that sheister lawyer Briggs the $5,500 and send him to the bank to take care of the transfer fee. Considering how much we paid him we might as well get some real use out of him, right? Then just send $94,500 to my bank account for the arms deal.
