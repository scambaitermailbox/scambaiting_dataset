This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and \nchemicals for the Farms and establishment of new farms in Swaziland.\n\n This land problem came when Zimbabwean President Mr.Robert Mugabe introduced \na new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and some few \nblack farmers, and this resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean \nwar veterans and some lunatics in the society. In fact a lot of people were \nkilled because of this Land reform Act for which my father was one of the \nvictims. It is against this background that, I and my family fled Zimbabwe \nfor fear of our lives and are currently staying in the ( Spain) where we are \nseeking political asylum and moreso have decided to transfer my father's \nmoney to a more reliable foreign account. since the law of Spain prohibits a \nrefugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any \nfinancial transaction throughout the territorial zone of Spain, As the eldest \nson of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine \nforeign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge \nof my government who are bent on taking everything we have got. The South \nAfrican government seems to be playing along with them. I am faced with the\ndilemma of moving this amount of money out of South Africa for fear of going \nthrough the same experience in future, both countries have similar political \nhistory.\n\nAs a businessman, I am seeking for a partner who I have to entrust my future \nand that of my family in his hands, I must let you know that this transaction \nis risk free. If you accept to assist me and my family, all I want you to do \nfor me, is to make an arrangements with the security company to clear the \nconsignment(funds) from their afiliate office here\nin the Spain as i have already given directives for the consignment to be \nbrought to the Spain from South Africa.But before then all modalities will \nhave to be put in place like change of ownership to the consignment and more \nimportantly this money I intend to use for investment. I have two options for \nyou.\n\nFirstly you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating \nyour account for this transaction. Or you can go into partnership with me for \nthe proper profitable investment of the money in your country. Whichever the \noption you want, feel free to notify me.
