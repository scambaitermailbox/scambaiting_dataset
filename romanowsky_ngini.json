We completely understand your concern, and\nassure you that our little business will be kept completely confidential. Nationally\nsince We are unable to travel to Spain ourselves, at least one other person\nmust be involved. As We wrote to you earlier, our friend Boris can be of\nassistance. Due to other pressing obligations he cannot travel to Spain until\nnext month, and we would certainly like to wrap this up sooner. Rest assured\nthat Boris has no information regarding our transaction. He simply handles\nlogistics. If We need something picked up or delivered, he arranges it. Only\nhighly trusted, long time persons are used. They are given no details other\nthan those necessary to complete the task. Sealed packages are not opened. \n\nFor our business, we will use Ivan Grozny. He is a\nRussian who has done many favors for our Family. He has worked for Boris as\nwell as for others. He has shown himself to be completely trustworthy, and\nefficient provided that operations are not complex or do not take unexpected\nturns. Although his character is beyond reproach, at least for business\npurposes, he does not excel at independent thinking and must be given precise\ndirections. His Spanish is rudimentary (English is passable if ungrammatical)\nbut sufficient to get around town (and negotiate with the ladies, for which he\nhas a considerable appetite). He is a citizen of Uzbekistan these days and can obtain\ntravel documents easily, as he has done some favors for local officials. \n\nYou are surely aware of the situation in Spain. Cell phone communications are heavily monitored. It was, after all, a cell phone that was used to detonate the explosives in the Madrid train bombings carried out by terrorists. The closer one is to Catalan, and especially in the Barcelona region, security Is discreet but pervasive. We must use a method of communication with your Mr. Adams that does not involve the use of cell phones. That should not prove particularly difficult. It is very hard to keep up with all of the modern technology, though We do try our best. Boris recommends using spoken voice over the Internet as the most reliable secure the real time method of communication. This, however, requires a good Internet service which might not be available in Valencia. Using land line telephone is perhaps best, if your Mr. Adams has access to one. Of course Ivan will not have his own standard telephone, However Boris has supplied reliable places to leave messages. He has supplied us with locations in Barcelona, Oropesa del Mar, and Menorca. He is checking on Valencia. These message drops will be 100% secure, but messages should nevertheless be confined to contact details. Once Ivan gets together with your Mr. Adams, they can certainly work out some means of effective communication should communication be necessary. However, talking in person, face-to-face in a discreet location remains the most secure form of communication, as it always has.\n\n\n\nSo, to recapitulate, this operation will involve only Ivan, for collection, and Boris, for banking matters. We do not discuss business amongst family, and since neither Alexei nor Nicholas will be directly involved, there is no need for them to know about it. If they did, they'd likely come up with interesting ways to spend our profit, and that would not be good for Family business. However, it is possible that after the transfer Ivan will meet up with Alexei in Ibiza or some other flesh pot. We will advise Ivan to keep the business details to himself, and in any case their brains are not likely to be the organs getting exercised. More email later, but the security issues deserved immediate attention.

However, talking in person, face-to-face in a discreet location remains the most secure form of communication, as it always has.\n<br><br>\n\n\nSo, to recapitulate, this operation will involve only Ivan, for collection, and Boris, for banking matters. We do not discuss business amongst family, and since neither Alexei nor Nicholas will be directly involved, there is no need for them to know about it. If they did, they'd likely come up with interesting ways to spend our profit, and that would not be good for Family business. However, it is possible that after the transfer Ivan will meet up with Alexei in Ibiza or some other flesh pot. We will advise Ivan to keep the business details to himself, and in any case their brains are not likely to be the organs getting exercised. More email later, but the security issues deserved immediate attention. Please advise your Mr. Taylor that Boris and Ivan has trustworthy as any of his most trusted associates, and both have been with us for several decades. /s/\n\n<br><br>\n\n<font color=\"purple\">\n<font face=\"Arial,Verdana\">\n<b>The matter is about to be punted to Ivan and Mr. Adams.

For example, he seems to\nthink that showing his identity card is a rare and special thing, when in fact\nof course he shows it for every serious transaction.\n\n<br><br>\n\nAgain, Barrister Ngini, your performance in this matter\nhas been professional. But your Mr. Adams, who cannot even send a proper email,\nhas been seriously deficient. He seems a shifty character and We hope that you\nhave him under observation. There will be moments when he alone has custody of\nthe entire sum, under your plan.<br><br>\n\nFinally, Ivan needs to know the form of the contents.\nYou have variously referred to &quot;cash&quot; and &quot;bullion&quot;. At the\nvery least, Ivan must know the total weight and dimensions of the physical\nobject he will be transporting to Barcelona.<br><br>\n\nIvan has established a safe house in Valencia, but plan\nto move the funds as quickly as possible. He is very uncomfortable with this\ntransaction and wants it over with as soon as possible.\n<br><br>\nWe see that you have sent us additional emails, and will\nget back to you from Bilibino.

My grandfather, William Alexeyevich, has just been taken to the hospital. The doctors are not sure what is wrong with him, possibly a stroke, but he is unable to speak clearly. Before they took him to the hospital he told me to look into his e-mail account and locate a piece of correspondence with a barrister in Africa. Yours was the only letter that involves an African. It is clear to me that some business involving money was involved so I thought I had better write to you.\n\nIn searching through his mail I saw some instructions to a certain Boris Godunov. Although I was able to access his yahoo account without difficulty, grandfather did not use any of his normal passwords at his other account so I can't access that mail. I did check our voicemail account, and noticed some messages which seemed to be from you, though they do not contain much information. Grandfather's obsession with secrecy can sometimes be a real pain, though we know he means well.\n\nIt seems that Mr. Ivan Grozny is also involved. I have met Ivan on a number of occasions, but do not have his contact information. Perhaps you do, and if so please inform him that Grandfather is in serious condition in the main hospital at present. He is instructed to phone me at Grandfather's phone number and provide me with a telephone contact so that I can explain the situation to him. Meanwhile, he should continue to carry out whatever duties have been assigned to him by my grandfather. Tell him I'll try to get ahold of Boris, but he should too. I'll leave a message for Ivan at the club in Barcelona, so you don't have to do that.\n\nI don't know what this business is all about, Grandfather had emptied or transferred any other correspondences to his secure account. There are copies of some correspondence here but they have been encrypted in PGP. I'm getting some of my talented friends to try to hack into the other account but it seems that Grandfather has actually learned something about Internet security after all the lectures that Boris and I have given him. Boris will be able to help if I can get ahold of him quickly. My father is indisposed, that's been pretty much the norm for several years, so he can't help. My brother Nicky is in Italy trying to help Grandfather extricate himself from some business snafu. Another bit of family business I'm not privileged to know anything about. Nicky gets to handle all that, when he feels like it. Grandfather calls it training for the day the Restoration arrives. (If he's deluged you with is visions of the Restoration, I apologize for him. He's an old man, the past grips him strongly.) That's not going to be in our lifetimes, or probably ever. But Nicky still waits for the day when he'll have it all. Between you and me, you're better off dealing with me, even if I'm only able to help a little bit. Nicky can't even handle siring an heir to the \"throne\", and that's not a very complicated matter for normal men.\n\nAccording to Grandfather's calendar on his PDA, Ivan is expected to return to Odessa late next week. That means that some business must be going on now. I hope that it goes successfully, but since grandfather didn't care to share with me the details of his exploits, I don't see how I can be of much further help. Whatever it is, I do hope that all goes well. Grandfather is just probably trying to use his network of old friends to put a little borscht in the bank. He's pretty good at poem together enough to cover Nicky's extravagant habits. I was planning to go off to Europe, hang out with some lads world reaction is going down in Amsterdam, but looks like all the stuff here for a bit.\n\nIf there is any way I can help out with whatever this matter is, please use this e-mail address. I have no idea who you are, so I prefer to use Grandfather's account to handle his business. Even though Nicky is the one usually targeted by bad people, I'm still his brother. It wouldn't come as a big surprise to me if it turned out that Grandfather's illness is no accident. False Dmitry's gang has used poison before. But then a family history is full of such things, as I'm sure you're aware if Grandfather has shared our family history. People think it's cool having royal blood, but it's not. It sucks unless you have the money to live like it. I've met a lot of Europe's so-called \"royalty\" and their a bunch of poofsters. Maybe it is different in Africa.\n\nPlease treat any correspondence between us is completely confidential. I assume some sort of attorney-client privilege exists between you and my Grandfather. Meanwhile let us both pray for his speedy recovery.

My grandfather, William Alexeyevich, has just been taken to the hospital. The doctors are not sure what is wrong with him, possibly a stroke, but he is unable to speak clearly. Before they took him to the hospital he told me to look into his e-mail account and locate a piece of correspondence with a barrister in Africa. Yours was the only letter that involves an African. It is clear to me that some business involving money was involved so I thought I had better write to you.<br><br>\n\nIn searching through his mail I saw some instructions to a certain Boris Godunov. Although I was able to access his yahoo account without difficulty, grandfather did not use any of his normal passwords at his other account so I can't access that mail. I did check our voicemail account, and noticed some messages which seemed to be from you, though they do not contain much information. Grandfather's obsession with secrecy can sometimes be a real pain, though we know he means well.<br><br>\n\nIt seems that Mr. Ivan Grozny is also involved. I have met Ivan on a number of occasions, but do not have his contact information. Perhaps you do, and if so please inform him that Grandfather is in serious condition in the main hospital at present. He is instructed to phone me at Grandfather's phone number and provide me with a telephone contact so that I can explain the situation to him. Meanwhile, he should continue to carry out whatever duties have been assigned to him by my grandfather. Tell him I'll try to get ahold of Boris, but he should too. I'll leave a message for Ivan at the club in Barcelona, so you don't have to do that.\n<br><br>\nI don't know what this business is all about, Grandfather had emptied or transferred any other correspondences to his secure account. There are copies of some correspondence here but they have been encrypted in PGP. I'm getting some of my talented friends to try to hack into the other account but it seems that Grandfather has actually learned something about Internet security after all the lectures that Boris and I have given him. Boris will be able to help if I can get ahold of him quickly. My father is indisposed, that's been pretty much the norm for several years, so he can't help. My brother Nicky is in Italy trying to help Grandfather extricate himself from some business snafu. Another bit of family business I'm not privileged to know anything about. Nicky gets to handle all that, when he feels like it. Grandfather calls it training for the day the Restoration arrives. (If he's deluged you with is visions of the Restoration, I apologize for him. He's an old man, the past grips him strongly.) That's not going to be in our lifetimes, or probably ever. But Nicky still waits for the day when he'll have it all. Between you and me, you're better off dealing with me, even if I'm only able to help a little bit. Nicky can't even handle siring an heir to the &quot;throne&quot;, and that's not a very complicated matter for normal men.<br><br>\n\nAccording to Grandfather's calendar on his PDA, Ivan is expected to return to Odessa late next week. That means that some business must be going on now. I hope that it goes successfully, but since grandfather didn't care to share with me the details of his exploits, I don't see how I can be of much further help. Whatever it is, I do hope that all goes well. Grandfather is just probably trying to use his network of old friends to put a little borscht in the bank. He's pretty good at poem together enough to cover Nicky's extravagant habits. I was planning to go off to Europe, hang out with some lads world reaction is going down in Amsterdam, but looks like all the stuff here for a bit.\n<br><br>\nIf there is any way I can help out with whatever this matter is, please use this e-mail address. I have no idea who you are, so I prefer to use Grandfather's account to handle his business. Even though Nicky is the one usually targeted by bad people, I'm still his brother. It wouldn't come as a big surprise to me if it turned out that Grandfather's illness is no accident. False Dmitry's gang has used poison before. But then a family history is full of such things, as I'm sure you're aware if Grandfather has shared our family history. People think it's cool having royal blood, but it's not. It sucks unless you have the money to live like it. I've met a lot of Europe's so-called &quot;royalty&quot; and their a bunch of poofsters. Maybe it is different in Africa.\n<br><br>\nPlease treat any correspondence between us is completely confidential. I assume some sort of attorney-client privilege exists between you and my Grandfather. Meanwhile let us both pray for his speedy recovery. He's had over eight decades on this planet and I'd like to see him aim for at least one more.\n\n<br><br>\n\nAlexey Romanov\n\n<br><br>\n\nHere is your message to Grandfather.\n\n<br><br>\n\n<font color=\"gray\">\n\n<font face=\"Georgia,Arial,Verdana\">\n\nDate: Wed, 8 September 11:15:14 +0100 (BST)<br>\n\nFrom: Send an Instant Message &quot;alexdonald\nngini&quot; alexdonaldn@yahoo.co.uk <br>\n\nSubject:REPLY URGENT<br>\n\nTo: &quot;William Romanowsky&quot; &lt;w*****@*******&gt;\n\n<br>\n\nDear William Romanowsky,\n\n<br>\n\nThanks for your quick reply.

Well, you should help me tell him that if Nigerians are gifted for the trade known as 419, it is not so for us Liberians. We only happen to be in Nigeria by an act of God and he should not attribute what we are trying to do with you as another case of scam. We do not do business with Nigerians because we do not trust them and we are aware of their antics.\n\nAgreed. We are aware that several people especially Nigerians use the name of my boss: Charles Gankay Taylor to make all sorts of proposition due to the fact that the whole world is aware Mr Taylor has hidden funds in security companies especially in Europe. A typical example is the attached letter which Alexei claims to have been received from one Jewel Taylor. This particular letter is a clear case of fraud and did not come from any of Mr Taylor's wives or concubines. No one has authority to oversee family matters and other matters affecting Mr Taylor but my person being the most senior adviser!

Well, you should help me tell him that if Nigerians are gifted for the trade known as 419, it is not so for us Liberians. We only happen to be in Nigeria by an act of God and he should not attribute what we are trying to do with you as another case of scam. We do not do business with Nigerians because we do not trust them and we are aware of their antics.<br><br>\n\nAgreed. We are aware that several people especially Nigerians use the name of my boss: Charles Gankay Taylor to make all sorts of proposition due to the fact that the whole world is aware Mr Taylor has hidden funds in security companies especially in Europe. A typical example is the attached letter which Alexei claims to have been received from one Jewel Taylor. This particular letter is a clear case of fraud and did not come from any of Mr Taylor's wives or concubines. No one has authority to oversee family matters and other matters affecting Mr Taylor but my person being the most senior adviser!<br> If therefore, you feel cowed by what your grandson has told you, for which Mr Taylor is now very mad, I do not need to bicker over this matter longer than relevant.
