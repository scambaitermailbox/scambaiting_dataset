YNAZWYRKIC</font></b><br><br>\n\nMrs. Bintu: <br><br>\n\nI received a message from Dr. Daniel Ibe, but I can't figure out what he means.\nCan you tell me what Ibe is trying to say? Here is a copy of the mail I just\nsent to Ibe: <br><br>\n\n**************************************************************<br><br>\n\nIbe:<br><br>\n\n do not understand this:<br><br>\n\n\"... I JUST CAME BACK FROM ABUJA THIS AFTERNOON BECAUSE OF YOUR CHEQUE IS NOW\nREADY TO SEND TO YOU THE MONEY I ASKED YOU TO SEND IS TO SEND THE CHEQUE TO YOU\n. <br><br>\n\nBUT IF YOU ARE NOT READY TO SEND FORGET IT...\" <br><br>\n\nI have tried to figure out what you mean, but it is giving me a headache. I\neven asked my lawyer, Bernie Maddel (of Maddel, Fanger, Saloot & Limbaugh) if\nhe knew what you were trying to say. He was here last evening to go over some\npaperwork regarding the accident. The insurance company is talking about $16\nmillion dollars in settlement, which sounds pretty good these days. \n<br><br>\nWhat do you think? Is the loss of an arm worth it? <br><br>\n\nWaiting to hear from you. Rudy Ynazwrykic <br><br>\n\n*********************************************************<br><br> \n\nMadam, this Ibe, is he a drinker? Maybe he was drunk when he sent this.
