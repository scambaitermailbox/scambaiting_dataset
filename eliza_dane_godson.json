I'm not happy! \n\n: I guess it wasn't that important then. Why the fuck did you send that message if you can't be bothered answering? \n\n: Well, bye for now. We can do this later. \n=============================================== \n: hello \n\n: are u there? \n\n: hello am here now \n\n: So am I. \n\n: Well? \n\n: I don't have all night to do this you know. \n=============================================== \n \n: I know you're there... \n\n: yes \n\n: So, what do we talk about? \n\n: Cat got your tongue? \n\n: Holy Odin, this is supposed to be instant chat, not sitting around twiddling thumbs! \n\n: so did you contact the bank? \n\n: Of course. I sent you an email about it. Is this all you wanted to chat about? \n\n: why are u sounding like that? \n\n: what did the bank respond to you? \n\n: They asked for ID but they weren't very clear so I asked them to spell it out. \n\n: dont you have any ID? \n\n: I have a passport but I can't copy that. I don't have a driver's licence (that's what boyfriends are for) and photomodels don't have work IDs. Australia doesn't have a national ID card (little Johnnie wanted one but he can't do squat about it now). What's left? \n\n: are u there? \n\n: Yep - go on! \n\n: the issue of the id will not be the problem \n\n: when do you think you will pay the money to the court for the documents \n\n: Fuck knows. There's nowhere around here to send money from and I'll be up here for at least the next two days. I haven't seen Ross (that's my brother) for over a year - he's been on active service and we're glad he's back alive and in one piece! \n\n: ok \n\n: that 2 days is ok \n\n: Oh yeah - while I think of it - what's the Affidavite look like? It must be something really special to cost 2500 bucks! \n\n: it is only the court who has the right to issue \n\n: Just something you said that I missed - if the issue of the ID ain't such a big deal then by Skadhi's bow why did the bank ask for some to start with? \n\n: remember we are talking about huge amount of money it is not all that easy to release without all this prove \n\n: OK - so why isn't it a problem any more? You're confusing me. \n\n: the most important thing now is the affidavite which will be secure from the court it will be in your name \n\n: the id is to compare the name with the application \n\n: if really it is you \n\n: but i can defend that ones the affidavite is there \n\n: Who's going to fill it out? And just so I know - what's going to be on it about me? That's why I asked for an example so I could give you what you needed. \n\n: But if you need the ID why say you don't need it? Freyja, soothe my aching head! \n\n: i have your full name and address to fill up the affidavite \n\n: the Affidavite of claim is the legal document that proved you as the rightful bonafide next of kin to the estate of late Mr.Douglas B.Dane \n\n: But do you have the ID? \n \n: Is there anything else apart from the bank account? He must have had a house and a car - and with that much cash, more than one! \n\n: Why did you buzz me!? I'm still here, for fuck's sake! \n\n: What ID? Tyr's hand, I told you there were problems and you didn't offer anything, did you? \n\n: what the bank need from you is your account to transfer the money ones the affidavite is proviede if you have id fine but if you do not have let me know i will defend it OK \n\n: How are you going to prove that I'm the one? \n\n: I am a lawyer if you provide the affidavite i will defend the issue of the ID \n\n: That's not going to be easy. Suppose they want to contact me? My folks and my friends know we've got no rellies in America and they'll say so - how do we keep this from them? \n\n: are u there? \n\n: hello \n\n: Hey, I asked you the question first! \n\n: what guestion \n\n: About if the court wants to know more about me, duh-brain! What do you do then? \n\n: are u there? \n\n: YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \n\n: ok \n\n: i want to leave now \n\n: so go ahead and contact the bank let them know you will provide them the affidavite in two days time \n\n: Fine by me - AJ wants us to get to bed and he's talking about a blow job, and that's making me all hot. \n\n: I told the bank there'll be delays, so calm down. Get yourself a blow job. AJ says it's very soothing. \n\n: CYA \nAnd there is... \n: do you have any other question let me know before i go \n\n: I thought you wanted to go but I got this ping. \n\n: i want to be sure you are clear \n\n: I want you to answer the question about the court asking questions about me and maybe wanting to talk to me - what are you going to do? \n\n: Hurry up, AJ just called out, I can't keep him waiting too long! \n\n: Fuck you! Just answer the question! \n\n: are you telling me fuck? \n\n: Well it got your attention! Now answer the fucking question! What will you do if the court wants to contact me? \n\n: I here to as your lawyer what ever the court want they will ask me not you \n\n: And if they want more info? What will you tell them? \n\n: the anly info the want for the affidavite of claim is your full name and address \n\n: Somehow I think that for 28 million they'll want a teensy bit more... \n\n: it is the bank that is transfering the money that is why they required the affidavite you will pay the court and they will issue the affidavite and sign then i will sign on your behalf that is all \n\n: then the transfer will be done \n\n: For your sake, I hope so! Odin Alfador tells us to trust our instincts, and I have a feeling that this court business is going to cause me grief... \n\n: no \n\n: all the court required from you is to pay the fee usd2.500 and they will issue the affidavite \n\n: I trust the Lord of the Aesir - His wisdom is true - you'd better walk carefully in this. Don't let me down! \n\n: trust me all will be well \n\n: Well, maybe. CYA \n\n: as soon as you pay the fee to the court every is done so feel free \n\n: CYA \n\n: what do you meant by CYA, \n\n: Fuck me - you don't know? CYA = See ya = goodbye, talk later! \n\n: i don understand you \n\n: Do you understand GOODBYE? \n\n: why are you sounding this way? \n\n: we never conclude \n\n: BECAUSE I WANT TO GO AND HAVE SEX AND YOU WON'T STOP BUTTING IN! \n\n: why do you tell me that? \n \n: For your information; I had a really good time after we stopped chatting. I think AJ was all worked up by the delay! \n\n: You called? \n\n: no you never give me your number \n\n: how are things? \n\n: No, you duh-brain, called as in wanted to chat? \n\n: okey \n\n: Fine, go ahead! \n\n: did you contact the bank as to know when you will provide the affidavite? \n\n: I thought you wanted to chat, not go on about your business! Tyr's hand, you're so boring! \n\n: the business is important then what ever you feel you want to chat ok \n\n: Well, I can do fuck all about it now - the bank knows about the delay. So I thought I'd get to know you. Have you lived in London all your life? \n\n: yes \n\n: What do you like about it the most? \n\n: are u married? \n\n: Excuse me, answer my question first! \n\n: I have alot of things to do now in the office as there is much people in my office \n\n: i will get back to you latter ok \n\n: OK! Then we'll answer our questions. Deal? \n\n: I said; is that a deal? \n\n: yes \n\n: CYA \n\n: hello \n\n: are u there? \n \n: Yes I am. \n\n: why keeping quite? \n\n: True. Now, where were we yesterday? \n\n: first of all,have you make the payment? \n\n: Holy Odin... don't you ever relax, smell the roses, get your rocks off? Is it always business? \n\n: Answer my question first have make the payment? \n\n: You still owe me an answer from yesterday, remember? \n\n: Is that yesterday question more important then this deal? \n\n: You agreed to answer my question (about life in London) and I agreed to answer your question (if I'm married) . I asked if it was a deal, you said yes, and that means you gave your word! We of the Aesir keep our word... do you? \n\n: ok \n\n: what do you want to know about london? \n\n: What's the best part of life in London? What's worth seeing? I mean to go there some day. \n\n: Do you want to come to london? \n\n: Eventually. That's not answering my question though, is it? \n\n: all this question is not important for now,while there is huge amout waiting for us in the bank \n\n: pls if you are not interested to receive this money notify me now as to look for another person \n\n[] \n: I AM NOT HEAR FOR A JOKE OK \n\n: Merciful Freyja! You agree to answer my question and then you just ignore it! \n\n: I'm not joking either! What the fuck do you think this is, some sort of game? Like fuck it is! \n\n: I BELIVED YOU MUST BE A JOKER \n\n: O RLY? Care to explain why you think that? \n\n: Are we talking about the business or how london look like? \n\n: OK, we'll talk business if that's all you care about! And the answer is no, we didn't get to head back to Sydney today - AJ's car broke down. Ross has agreed to take us back tomorrow, but it's not good odds on us getting back before COB Friday. That's a problem because of the Australia Day long weekend - nothing before Tuesday. \n\n: The bank called me on telephone this moring that they never had from you and you dont even care ,you are there asking me about london,did i contacted you b/c of london? \n\n: I didn't contact the bank because the document is yours to collect. They have nothing to do with getting it - you do that. That dike  has no right to tell you what's on my mind. Stupid bitch should keep to her accounts and stop trying to psychoanalyse me. \n\n: So when are you making the payment?knowing fully well that is the only thing holding this transfer? \n\n: Either tomorrow or Tuesday. \n\n: Why not try do it tomorrow? to enable us conclude this transfer \n\n: If I can I will. I don't know what Western Union offices I can find on the way. Also, since you can bet Ross and AJ will be with me all the time, I won't be able to keep it from them - which is important since we have to keep this quiet, as well you know. \n\n: when do you think you will be alone to do it? \n\n: Totally NFI. I can only hope and try, but no guarantees for Friday. \n\n: To perfect all this documents legally in your name.

Why? \n\n: i just want to know \n\n: Funny, that - I just wanted to know about London and you chucked a wobbly!

Since when do banks want to encourage people to withdraw millions?

I'll drop them a line to let them know the affidavite may be a while longer. \n\n: I suppose a few words about London are too much to ask? \n\n: droping few word to the bank as to know your possition is very important and let them know the day you will send the affidavite \n\n: Doesn't stop you from telling me about your home town does it?! \n\n: you willvisit me here in london as soon as the business through there you will see things in by your self \n\n: Now that I will hold you to!

I'm not happy! \n\n<br /><span class=\"ed\">ED</span>: I guess it wasn't that important then.

I sent you an email about it. Is this all you wanted to chat about? \n\n<br /><span class=\"pg\">PG</span>: why are u sounding like that? \n\n<br /><span class=\"pg\">PG</span>: what did the bank respond to you? \n\n<br /><span class=\"ed\">ED</span>: They asked for ID but they weren't very clear so I asked them to spell it out. \n\n<br /><span class=\"pg\">PG</span>: dont you have any ID? \n\n<br /><span class=\"ed\">ED</span>: I have a passport but I can't copy that. I don't have a driver's licence (that's what boyfriends are for) and photomodels don't have work IDs. Australia doesn't have a national ID card (little Johnnie wanted one but he can't do squat about it now). What's left? \n\n<br /><span class=\"pg\">PG</span>: are u there? \n\n<br /><span class=\"ed\">ED</span>: Yep - go on! \n\n<br /><span class=\"pg\">PG</span>: the issue of the id will not be the problem \n\n<br /><span class=\"pg\">PG</span>: when do you think you will pay the money to the court for the documents \n\n<br /><span class=\"ed\">ED</span>: Fuck knows. There's nowhere around here to send money from and I'll be up here for at least the next two days. I haven't seen <span class=\"rd\">Ross</span> (that's my brother) for over a year - he's been on active service and we're glad he's back alive and in one piece! \n\n<br /><span class=\"pg\">PG</span>: ok \n\n<br /><span class=\"pg\">PG</span>: that 2 days is ok \n\n<br /><span class=\"ed\">ED</span>: Oh yeah - while I think of it - what's the Affidavite look like? It must be something really special to cost 2500 bucks! \n\n<br /><span class=\"pg\">PG</span>: it is only the court who has the right to issue \n\n<br /><span class=\"ed\">ED</span>: Just something you said that I missed - if the issue of the ID ain't such a big deal then by Skadhi's bow why did the bank ask for some to start with? \n\n<br /><span class=\"pg\">PG</span>: remember we are talking about huge amount of money it is not all that easy to release without all this prove \n\n<br /><span class=\"ed\">ED</span>: OK - so why isn't it a problem any more? You're confusing me. \n\n<br /><span class=\"pg\">PG</span>: the most important thing now is the affidavite which will be secure from the court it will be in your name \n\n<br /><span class=\"pg\">PG</span>: the id is to compare the name with the application \n\n<br /><span class=\"pg\">PG</span>: if really it is you \n\n<br /><span class=\"pg\">PG</span>: but i can defend that ones the affidavite is there \n\n<br /><span class=\"ed\">ED</span>: Who's going to fill it out? And just so I know - what's going to be on it about me? That's why I asked for an example so I could give you what you needed. \n\n<br /><span class=\"ed\">ED</span>: But if you need the ID why say you don't need it? Freyja, soothe my aching head! \n\n<br /><span class=\"pg\">PG</span>: i have your full name and address to fill up the affidavite \n\n<br /><span class=\"pg\">PG</span>: the Affidavite of claim is the legal document that proved you as the rightful bonafide next of kin to the estate of late Mr.Douglas B.Dane \n\n<br /><span class=\"pg\">PG</span>: But do you have the ID? \n \n<br /><span class=\"ed\">ED</span>: Is there anything else apart from the bank account? He must have had a house and a car - and with that much cash, more than one! \n\n<br /><span class=\"ed\">ED</span>: Why did you buzz me!? I'm still here, for fuck's sake! \n\n<br /><span class=\"ed\">ED</span>: What ID? Tyr's hand, I told you there were problems and you didn't offer anything, did you? \n\n<br /><span class=\"pg\">PG</span>: what the bank need from you is your account to transfer the money ones the affidavite is proviede if you have id fine but if you do not have let me know i will defend it OK \n\n<br /><span class=\"ed\">ED</span>: How are you going to prove that I'm the one? \n\n<br /><span class=\"pg\">PG</span>: I am a lawyer if you provide the affidavite i will defend the issue of the ID \n\n<br /><span class=\"ed\">ED</span>: That's not going to be easy. Suppose they want to contact me? My folks and my friends know we've got no rellies in America and they'll say so - how do we keep this from them? \n\n<br /><span class=\"pg\">PG</span>: are u there? \n\n<br /><span class=\"pg\">PG</span>: hello \n\n<br /><span class=\"ed\">ED</span>: Hey, I asked you the question first! \n\n<br /><span class=\"pg\">PG</span>: what guestion \n\n<br /><span class=\"ed\">ED</span>: About if the court wants to know more about me, duh-brain! What do you do then? \n\n<br /><span class=\"pg\">PG</span>: are u there? \n\n<br /><span class=\"ed\">ED</span>: YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \n\n<br /><span class=\"pg\">PG</span>: ok \n\n<br /><span class=\"pg\">PG</span>: i want to leave now \n\n<br /><span class=\"pg\">PG</span>: so go ahead and contact the bank let them know you will provide them the affidavite in two days time \n\n<br /><span class=\"ed\">ED</span>: Fine by me - <span class=\"aj\">AJ</span> wants us to get to bed and he's talking about a blow job, and that's making me all hot. \n\n<br /><span class=\"ed\">ED</span>: I told the bank there'll be delays, so calm down. Get yourself a blow job. <span class=\"aj\">AJ</span> says it's very soothing. \n\n<br /><span class=\"ed\">ED</span>: CYA <br /><br />\n\n<i>And there is... </i><br /><br />\n\n<span class=\"pg\">PG</span>: do you have any other question let me know before i go \n\n<br /><span class=\"ed\">ED</span>: I thought you wanted to go but I got this ping. \n\n<br /><span class=\"pg\">PG</span>: i want to be sure you are clear \n\n<br /><span class=\"ed\">ED</span>: I want you to answer the question about the court asking questions about me and maybe wanting to talk to me - what are you going to do? \n\n<br /><span class=\"ed\">ED</span>: Hurry up, <span class=\"aj\">AJ</span> just called out, I can't keep him waiting too long! \n\n<br /><span class=\"ed\">ED</span>: Fuck you! Just answer the question! \n\n<br /><span class=\"pg\">PG</span>: are you telling me fuck? \n\n<br /><span class=\"ed\">ED</span>: Well it got your attention! Now answer the fucking question! What will you do if the court wants to contact me? \n\n<br /><span class=\"pg\">PG</span>: I here to as your lawyer what ever the court want they will ask me not you \n\n<br /><span class=\"ed\">ED</span>: And if they want more info? What will you tell them? \n\n<br /><span class=\"pg\">PG</span>: the anly info the want for the affidavite of claim is your full name and address \n\n<br /><span class=\"ed\">ED</span>: Somehow I think that for 28 million they'll want a teensy bit more... \n\n<br /><span class=\"pg\">PG</span>: it is the bank that is transfering the money that is why they required the affidavite you will pay the court and they will issue the affidavite and sign then i will sign on your behalf that is all \n\n<br /><span class=\"pg\">PG</span>: then the transfer will be done \n\n<br /><span class=\"ed\">ED</span>: For your sake, I hope so! Odin Alfador tells us to trust our instincts, and I have a feeling that this court business is going to cause me grief... \n\n<br /><span class=\"pg\">PG</span>: no \n\n<br /><span class=\"pg\">PG</span>: all the court required from you is to pay the fee usd2.500 and they will issue the affidavite \n\n<br /><span class=\"ed\">ED</span>: I trust the Lord of the Aesir - His wisdom is true - you'd better walk carefully in this.
