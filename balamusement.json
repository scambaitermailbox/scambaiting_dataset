Oh, and the cost was back to $13,500. We talked about that a bit\nand I almost forgot to keep the hoarse voice. I wonder if he noticed\n:-). Also mentioned that I could fly on next week, but he insisted on\nthe money transfer. Guess he didn't want to be ridiculed at the airport\nagain :-). I asked him to fax me the details about money transfer the\nnext monday, when I call and request him (I don't want others to get\nthe fax). \n</p>\n<p>\nLater the same evening my \"brother\" bala called me on two occasions. I\nforgot to hoarse, but just said I'm getting better :-). I told him what\nI had agreed with mr. Johnson Igba of the security firm.\nMan, bala must love his own voice as he kept on talking and talking,\nthough I don't understand half of what he says :-).\n</p>\n<p>\nSo on Saturday and Sunday goes with no calls. Guess the scammers have\ntheir family too and don't do scams outside office hours :-). \n</p>\n<P>Comes monday and what is a better way to start the day than with a call\nfrom my \"brother\"!. I tell him, that as agreed, I will request fax with\nmoney transfer information from mr johnson. After this call I decide to\ncall mr. johnson and request the fax. He is bit baffled, what do I need\nthe fax for. Just send the money to ungabungamunga (didn't understand\nthe name). He agreeds to send the fax because I don't understand the\nname.</P>\n\n<P>Two hours go by and my \"brother\" calls. I tell him that I'm bit worried\nas there is no fax. He assures me that the security firm is trustworthy\nand not to worry. Then it's the normal yadda yadda yaa again.\nPreviously I listed the call durations. At this time I've lost track.\nIn total I've been on phone with him for more than an hour and on his\ndime!</P>\n\n<P>He must have called the dude in amsterdam as the fax soon arrives. \n(to be continued)...</P></i>\n\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "", "author_role": "bait", "body": "Antti notes:\nPS. the number 7 at the issuing date is only fake letter on that\nitinerary, others are originals shifted from one place to another. 2.5\nhours work :-).", "raw": "<h3><font color=\"blue\">\"ANTTI\"'s ITINERARY (NOT!)</font></h3> \n \n<img src=\"images/antti-travel.jpg\"> \n\n<i>\n<p>\nAntti notes:<br>\nPS. the number 7 at the issuing date is only fake letter on that\nitinerary, others are originals shifted from one place to another. 2.5\nhours work :-).\n</p></i>\n", "comments": []}]}
