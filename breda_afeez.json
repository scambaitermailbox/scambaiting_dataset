I want to explain a few things. So please sit back and enjoy the ride.\n\nA few weeks ago you sent me an email telling me that I could earn a lot of money. I only had to do a few simple things. My father always teached me: if things seem too good to be true, they are too good to be true. So was your proposal. From moment one I knew your proposal was fake. No one would ever believe that you would pay me millions of dollars, which were just waiting for me. I knew you were a fraudster. You still are.\n\nI decided I could do 2 things: 1) either throw your proposal away or 2) make fun with you. I decided for option 2. And to be honest Afeez, I had a lot of fun. Fun in making you believe that I would accept your proposal. Fun in making you believe I would do everything you asked.\n\nIt was also very funny that you asked me to come to Dubai. The nice thing was that the KLM flight arrived very early in the morning. So you, or Steve, or both had to go to the airport and had to wait for someone who was not on board. Frustrating, wasn't it? You also held up a sign with Bolletjesslikkers Hier. I told you it was the name of an oil company. It is not. It means: I am waiting for drug smugglers. The nice thing is that I asked someone to make a picture of the man holding the sign. A very clear picture. No, I am not going to send you this picture. Ihave forwarded it to the FBI and to the Dubai Police. I also gave them your telephone number (971-50-3961849). They were very happy with that.\n\nIt was also very funny that Steve had to stand in front of the hotel with a balloon. Hot day, wasn't it? Jee, and Jack was not showing up. Of course not, Jack was at home, drink a cold beer and sending email messages to you. Signed with \"sent from the Burj Al Arab Hotel\". Of course, you or Steve visited this hotel to look for me.\n\nHow did the cognac and the cigars taste? You had to pay for them of course, but Jack didn't show up. You now know why.\n\nAfeez, I had a lot of fun. But the fun is not over yet. I am going to forward your email message to your email provider. You will be cut off in a few days time. I willalso send all our emails toa special web site, which contains similar stories of clever people making fun of stupid 419 fraudster. It is a lot of fun to read these stories. Let me be honest; you are not the stupidest scammer around. You are stupid of course, very stupid, but some people are even more stupid. But people all over the world will get to know your name. And they will have a good time reading how stupid you are.\n\nThere is a good chance that you will be picked up by the law enforcement authorities in your country in the next couple of weeks. If I were you, I would not sleep very comfortable any more. But that is the price you have to pay for trying to rob other people. Just fair, don't you agree?\n\nWell, Afeez, I hope you will fail in doing what you pursue.\n\nThanks again for the good time, MUGU !!\n\nJack Breda", "raw": "<hr>\n<span class=\"jb\">Jack Breda</span><br><br><span class=\"ast\">\n\n\nHello Afeez,<br><br>\n\nthis will be my last email to you.
