I was expecting the worst, so I'm very glad to hear that you're OK.  Are you still in hospital?  <br /><br />\n\nI'm a fairly good judge of character, and to me you seem like an honest, brave woman, and a good mother to Samuel.  I must ask of you, though, to put yourself in my shoes.  After seeing my name on a Christian website (which one, if I may ask?), out of the blue, someone from Africa contacts me asking me to distribute her money.  I have no proof that the money exists, any identification from you, aside from a picture of a woman in her mid-20s, nor a single answer to my simple questions below.  Scroll down on this message:  you can still see them if you don't remember.  <br /><br />\n\nI will be frank with you.  As I mentioned in a previous correspondence, I've got a good number of children, so I'm quite used to being ignored.  It doesn't necessarily mean I like it, especially when there's a great deal of money involved here.  The way I see it, is that the ball in completely in your court; it's not my money yet to distribute, and you're the one that doesn't have long to go.

Please call me either Rabbi Zona or Dr Zona.<br /><br />\n\nI take high offense to your latest missive.  I don't want to sound cold, especially in light of your circumstances, but let's talk straight.<br /><br />\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by:<br />\n>><i>thank you for your message, you see the essence of exposing myself to you is for your complete observation to know the truth</i>. <br /><br />\n\nMy issue was not only that you steadfastly refused to expose yourself, as it were, so there's no way of me knowing the truth.  <br /><br />\n\nYou also said:<br />\n>><i>so there is no reason for you to doubt or argue the formalities</i>.<br /><br />\n\nAgain, why should I not doubt the formalities?  I have absolutely zero identification or proof that you and your <span class=\"wl\">mother</span> are who you say you are, let alone whether or not the money actually exists.\n<br /><br />\nWe seem to be going around in circles here.  For the final time, I will not contact the security company again until I see some identification.  The onus of proof is on you, Shmuli.  Of course I know you both exist - someone is writing me, after all - but \nofficially I have no corroboration of this.<br /><br />\n\n>><i> i therefore , advised that you try to cooperate and abide with</i> ...<br />\nYou're 22 years old, right?  Let's get something else straight.  Respectfully, bubbeleh, you know bubkas..  I represent a major congregation and charitable organisation, donating millions of dollars each year to charities all around the world..  Rodef Bubbameissah is listed on NASDAQ (quote: URAFKWT) and have thousands of members internationally.  Don't advise me to try to cooperate and abide with anyone. I'm a rabbi and a mohel, but I'm also a businessman.  Keep in mind that it's your mother who contacted me to begin with.  You need me to move your money, and I've always maintained, and still maintain, that I'm happy to do so and help out.  But please don't take me for a fool.  <br /><br />\n\nIf you want my assistance, here's what you do:<br /><br />\n\n1.  <span class=\"sz\">Shayndl</span> tells me she wrote you two emails that have gone unanswered.

So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken to him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran .  And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran ; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan ; and into the land of Canaan they came.

And the LORD appeared to Abram, and said, to your seed will I give this land: and there built him an altar to the LORD, who appeared to him.  And he removed from there to a mountain on the east of Bethel , and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west and Hai on the east: and there he built an altar to the LORD, and called on the name of the LORD. And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.  And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.  And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that you are a fair woman to look on: Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see you, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save you alive. Say, I pray you, you are my sister: that it may be well with me for your sake; and my soul shall live because of you. And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt , the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair. The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house. And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels. And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram's wife. And Pharaoh called Abram and said, what is this that you have done to me? why did you not tell me that she was your wife? Why said you, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold your wife, take her, and go your way.
