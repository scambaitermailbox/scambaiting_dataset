Don't you just get so tired of MEN sometimes? He is only interested in the money he is going to make. Mr. Noogie is even offering me a first-class plane ticket.

know i had so many things up in my head concerning the transaction though it doesnt count in pertaining to our transaction but i saw it from another point of view.<br><br>\n\nHonney I am so sorry i have said it before that you should try reason with me and put me right in advices but not to blame me.<br><br>\n\nHonney I know you are not a doctor but i felt you could do something in assistance because if you were here you could have assisted me in a way or the other.<br><br>\n\nShe talked about you while i was with her yesterday at the hospital i.e my daughter.while i was trying to encourage her before she slept off.<br><br>\n\nHonney you could please come to my rescue if you care please i am in a hooked coner at the moment a very tight one though.\n<br><br>\nI angrily stormed Mr.Ochuko's office today asking him why he has to pick up the money without signing the document and he confirmed it before that the money is there ,that he refuse to pick the money because of my reactions to him ,he stressed that he is not ready to pick up the money ,so all you have to do now is to proceed to the <span class=\"wu\">western union</span> office where you payed the money and ask them to resend the money on Patienece Okonta name so that she can pick up the money and pay to another lawyer that will sign the documents ,i am very sure the transfer of the funds will be done withing 48hours of the endorsement of the document by another lawyer .And in that case you will still have some money for your personal use while you send over my own part for me so that i can take care of my kids .I really want you down here if you wish to come before you proceed to Russia.But please have the money picked and resend immediately in the name of Mrs.Patience Okonta.<br><br>\n\nHonney you dont have to let this happen to me please do come to my rescue.I have to do something my babby is dieing come to my rescue Maya dont dump me please i didnt mean to do it that way i only thought it was a nice proceedure.<br><br>\n\nHoping to hear from you a possitive response to my E-mail.<br><br>\n\nPray for my babby as well .I am Sorry I love you though.<br><br>\n\nWith Regards, <br>\nMaduka Peters Esq.\n\n</span><br><br>\n\n", "comments": []}, {"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "", "subject": "", "author_role": "scam", "body": "Thu, 22
