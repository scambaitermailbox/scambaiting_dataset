    "---------------------------------\nHello  \t\tHello,\n \nThe Banca Unione di Credito here in Switzerland, is one of the Largest Swiss banks licensed to operate Private banking in Switzerland.\n\nMy Name is Adrian Muster; and I used to work at the Banca Unione di Credito in Switzerland.\n\nAs an Investment manager with the bank, I have handled a lot of secret, tax free, investments offshore, which are not traceable for our numerous international private clients, which include Americans, Africans and Asians in line with their instructions. Because of the secrets and personal nature of these Investments we must work one on one with the clients to ensure full confidentiality.\n \nThe real purpose for contacting you is that, I have a very small proposition and I need your cooperation.\n\nEight years ago a client I worked with, a Mr. John de Balint; a Yugoslavian Oil Trader with Yukos Oil in Russia invested a lot of money in 4 different time deposit accounts, each for a 4 year period in our Offshore B ank in the Cayman Islands.\n\nBefore the maturity of these innvestments, the Bank was informed by the police; of his death in an oilrig explosion.\n \t\t\nAt the time of his death he left a Will and the Will stated that his only son (Who is in jail, in Sri Lanka for drug offences on a 25-year sentence), was the only beneficiary to all his assets. Legally, the son cannot make the claim, so there is no next-of-kin to claim the funds.\n\nThe Funds have been dormant for the last 36 months and by the instructions here at our Switzerland head office, it will be declared unclaimed by the bank very soon.\n \nI just retired from the bank and I have spoken to Mr. John de Balint\u00d5s son about this proposal also. I am therefore compelled to seek your cooperation to salvage the investments for the son and the rest for the both of us. I have decided to contact you and provide you with the necessary documents and assistances so you can claim the funds as the next of Kin to Mr. John de Balint.\n\nThe son will also be confirming your identity to the bank, as a known person to him and the funds will be transferred to you, because he cannot claim it himself, as the law forbids anyone currently associated with such criminal charges to make such a claim and if these funds are not claimed soon; they will be deposited into the Swiss Treasury as unclaimed funds. If this happens, no one can make claim to the money again.\n\nYou will have to hold 80% in lieu for the son and the balance can be shared between us based on our agreement.\n\nPlease respond immediately via any of my secure email addresses below indicating your interest or otherwise, and more details and relevant documents that will help you understand my proposition and how to proceed.\n\n  adrian.muster@lugano.com\n \n I am looking forward to your response and\ncooperation.\n \n Respectfully,\n \n Adrian Muster."
