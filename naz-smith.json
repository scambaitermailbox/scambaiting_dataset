This is, of course, my inherited money. Smith does deserve a \"finder's fee\", but certainly not 60% ($6,000,000.00!) I am a reasonable and generous woman but I am not about to give the lion's share of MY MONEY to someone who has done little.\n<br><br>\n4) Am I to pay you a commission for your work in this transfer? If so, what is the proper fee? Additionally, there must be some item that you have been desiring, and it would be my very great pleasure to bring it for you. You do realize that money is not an obstacle.\n<br><br>\n5) My attorney, Mr. Jardon, and I will bring the designated funding to secure the release of the money, along with a few thousand extra dollars, in case of an unforseen circumstance (they do have a way of \"popping up\", don't they?)\n<br><br>\n6) Will you secure a pair of reservations in a fine hotel for us? We will require 2 suites of rooms, perhaps on the same floor, but certainly not adjoining, (Mr. Nazzer will not be accompanying me). Mr. Jardon (who is widowed) will require his own suite for his accommodation. The hotel should also be equipped with an excellent restaurant, of course.<br><br>\n\n7) Please, when you meet our flight, have a limosine at our disposal. I do not wish to get into some tiny, and dirty taxicab with several other people. This is an absolute requirement, I MUST insist on this!!!\n<br><br>\nPlease be so kind to reply as soon as possible. Time passes quickly, and time is money.
