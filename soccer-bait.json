If your not getting paid by your club how do you make\nyour money ? Have you got a part time job ??\nYour weight seems very good, seems to be a lack of size, 5 foot tall ?  We\nmight have to play you in midfield as 5 foot will be too small for a defender\nbut we'll see.  Your still young arent you so you could grow more.\nWhile i'm away i'll take your coaches email address i saw on that card and i'll\nemail him when i have time this weekend hopefully.

As Manchester United\ntravel all over the world I should be able to get a very cheap deal for you to\nfly but you will have to pay 3% of the air fare (Probably only 20 pounds).  The\nchoice is yours, either get to Egypt and get the free flight or pay for your\nflight and claim the money back after the week of training.
