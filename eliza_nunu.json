The current civil war here has not helped matters either and America's influence after the 11th Sept.2001 terrorist attack in U.S.A. has caused lots of damages.\nIn order, to avoid the fund being returned to Abidjan through Bank of England to the Treasury account with the Central Bank of Cote d'Ivoire (BCEAO) which will result to investigation, probable prosecution and confiscation, you are hereby advised to apply and process the Drug Free/ Money Laundry/ Anti-Terrorist Fund clearance certificate from International Financial Credit Commission (IFCC) UK\nWe have also written a report on the transfer to the International Financial Credit Commission (IFCC) explaining our role in the transaction. We should co-operate to avoid any ugly situation in this transaction.\nThe processing of the certificates is simple exercise that involves filling of the forms, payment of the necessary fees and the certificate will be issued.
