You'd better continue your education at University, and\nconcentrate on taking some English classes, learn the basics of grammar,\npunctuation, etc, if you plan to come to America to live. \n\n3) \"...Since you are living...\" I am not going to be living in Spain. I am\nLEAVING for Spain tonight around midnight. I will arrive in Madrid at 10:25AM,\nrent an automobile, and motor up to Costanza. I live in Arkansas, remember? \n\n4) \"...why don't you contact the officer in Spain so he can meet with you as\nsoon as\nyou get to Spain so you can claim it there and make every necessary\narrangement...\" I do not have a contact telephone number for the officer in\nSpain. I don't imagine there would be anybody in the office on a Sunday,\nanyway. \n\n5) \"...I am in London. You can reach me on 44-704-011-1544...\" London? I\nthought you were in Valencia. \n\n6) \"...I can come and meet you so we can make further transfer to Arkansas...\"\nIf you can travel from London to Costanza, we can meet there. There are no\nairline flights to Costanza, as it is a small village in the Pyrenees\nmountains. They don't have much of a railway station, which is why I'm renting\na car to get there. \n\n6) I could arrange to have the consignment shipped at my expense, I checked\nwith an air-freight company, and a 73-pound cargo would cost me less than $800\nto ship. I was right. Inonye Roberts is a thief. $25,000 my foot!!! \n\n7) \"...but note that you are to pay for some charges before it can be release\nto you...\" I don't know how much the charges might be. Is there any way you can\nfind out, and let me know before I leave for Madrid? I'll either call Elaine\nfrom New York, and she can tell me if there is any word from you, or I will\nlook for an Internet port at Kennedy airport, and check my e-mail tonight. \n\n8) \"...I don't know if it will be up to this previous bill...\" It better NOT\nbe, but you can never tell, they might try to stick me for the charges, AND the\nfreightage, which would REALLY make me very angry! See if you can find out\nanything about this deal, and I hope to hear from you by tonight. \n\n\nThat's all the update I have for you. Keep me posted. \n\nYour friend, Ray"], "messages": [{"from_name": "", "to_name": "", "date": "2004-12-22 00:00", "subject": "await your news", "author_role": "scam", "body": "Received: from debian.desiredelille.be ()\n\n\nDear Friend,\nI wish to introduce myself.

If I could bring some back\nwith me, it would be a major coup for me, and the profit from re-selling them\nwould be enormous! \n\nAs I waited patiently, I was soon joined by these 2 fellows, who were so\ngrateful for my generosity in allowing them to conduct their business, they\ninsisted on hosting me to a wonderful dinner, many drinks of a local beverage\nknown as \"rel\u00b4mpago blanco\", and an immediate trip to their remote village to\nget the zithers.
